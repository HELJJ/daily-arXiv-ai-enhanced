The surrogate model attains\nnear-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\\approx 0.0004\n\\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\\times$ faster one-step inference. When\nsubstituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it\naccelerates end-to-end training by $>\\!100\\times$. We show that the surrogate\nand simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology\nto assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable.
