While\nself-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are\nnot particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --\nlet alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and\nnoisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model\nbased on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of\nprivacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our\npre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input\nreconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even\nfrom less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation\nlies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level\nsimilarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.\nWith our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted\nmasked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both\ngranular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level\nassociative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich\nrepresentation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,\neven under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer\nand age-induced distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "A self-supervised learning framework for battery capacity estimation using privacy-friendly EV charging data, achieving 31.9% lower error than benchmarks under domain shifts.", "motivation": "Address practical limitations in battery capacity estimation due to privacy regulations and labeled data shortages, while maintaining robustness to real-world data distribution shifts.", "method": "Self-supervised pre-training with snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, combining contrastive learning to capture high-level similarities among fragmented charging snippets.", "result": "Model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 31.9% lower test error, demonstrating strong performance under manufacturer and age-induced domain shifts.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework effectively learns rich representations from privacy-friendly data and shows superior generalization capability for battery capacity estimation in real-world EV operations."}}

Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire\nspecialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great\nutility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two\nsecurity-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make\nthem infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network\nconnection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the\nsystem vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a\nsensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms\nproduce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work\naddresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private\noptimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language\nmodels. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering\nenhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our\noptimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language\nmodel (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B).

This work investigates the\nintrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary\ncontributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic\nfailures, we propose \\textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified\nframework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a\ncausal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context\n(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a\nhallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \\textbf{commitment\nlayer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from\nfactuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We\nobserve a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret\nusing the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \\textbf{associative\npathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \\textbf{contextual pathway}\n(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as\n\\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the\ncoherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation\n($\\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are\npredictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a\nmechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the\nTransformer architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the intrinsic architectural causes of LLM hallucination through Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), identifying a commitment layer where hallucinations become inevitable and revealing a conflict between associative and contextual pathways.", "motivation": "To understand the fundamental architectural origins of hallucination in Large Language Models, moving beyond surface-level analysis to trace internal semantic failures.", "method": "Proposed Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST) framework integrating interpretability techniques, identified commitment layers, and analyzed dual-process computational pathways (associative vs contextual).", "result": "Found strong negative correlation (\u03c1 = -0.863) between contextual pathway coherence and hallucination rates, identified predictable failure modes like Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks.", "conclusion": "Hallucinations are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness in Transformer architecture, resulting from conflicts between fast associative and slow contextual processing pathways."}}
