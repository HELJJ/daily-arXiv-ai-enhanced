### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DTO is a self-contained machine unlearning method for LLMs that directly optimizes token-level objectives without external resources, achieving superior forget quality while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM unlearning methods rely on external resources like auxiliary models or commercial services, which are impractical and pose privacy risks. A self-contained approach is needed.

Method: Direct token optimization (DTO) identifies target tokens for unlearning and non-target tokens for utility preservation, then directly optimizes token-level objectives without external dependencies.

Result: DTO achieves up to 16.8× improvement in forget quality on benchmark datasets compared to latest baselines while maintaining comparable model utility.

Conclusion: DTO provides an effective, self-contained solution for machine unlearning in LLMs that eliminates dependency on external resources while achieving superior unlearning performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAMA is a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent framework for procedural activity understanding that uses multimedia-returning tools for interleaved multimodal reasoning without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural activity assistants have broad applications but system development for such assistants is still underexplored.

Method: TAMA framework enables interleaved multimodal reasoning using multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting.

Result: Experimental results on ProMQA-Assembly dataset show improved performance for vision-language models (GPT-5 and MiMo-VL), with ablation studies supporting effectiveness of multimedia-returning tools and flexible tool selection.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates thinking with images paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, advancing development of procedural activity assistants.

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, multi-step deep research tasks in enterprise settings, requiring information from both public web and private company knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on simple questions or web-only queries, but enterprise settings require complex research across heterogeneous data sources including productivity software, cloud files, emails, chats, and the open web.

Method: Created 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains using a synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification. Tasks are grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context, evaluating agents on recall, factual accuracy, and report quality.

Result: Evaluated diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models (GPT, Llama, Qwen) and strategies, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and advancement paths for enterprise deep research.

Conclusion: DRBench provides an effective benchmark for assessing AI agents on complex enterprise research tasks, highlighting critical areas for improvement in enterprise deep research capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrimeX is a dataset with opinion survey data from 858 US residents, including belief explanations and worldview assessments, showing how belief information can improve language model personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better represent individual users to language models by investigating if aspects of belief systems can improve model alignment and personalization.

Method: Developed PrimeX dataset containing public opinion survey data with two additional belief sources: written explanations from respondents and Primal World Belief survey for worldview assessment.

Result: The additional belief information in PrimeX demonstrates value for personalizing language models and benefits both NLP and psychological research communities.

Conclusion: Belief explanations and worldview information can enhance language model personalization, opening new research avenues in NLP and psychology.

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO introduces an evaluation framework for personalized reasoning in LLMs, showing current models struggle with adapting responses to individual user preferences in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development separates task-solving from preference alignment, failing in human-facing applications where correct but generic responses don't meet individual user needs, especially in cold-start situations without prior interaction history.

Method: PREFDISCO transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences, creating scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains depending on user context.

Result: Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks shows 29.0% of naive personalization attempts produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, while generic responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively.

Conclusion: Personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than emerging naturally, and PREFDISCO establishes it as a measurable research frontier revealing fundamental limitations in current LLMs' interactive capabilities.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasFreeBench is a benchmark that standardizes evaluation of bias mitigation methods in LLMs by comparing 8 mainstream techniques across unified test scenarios and introducing a response-level metric called Bias-Free Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation studies use inconsistent baselines and metrics, and rely on probability-based evaluations that don't reflect real-world usage where users interact with model responses rather than probabilities.

Method: Reorganizes existing datasets into unified query-response format, compares 8 bias mitigation methods (4 prompting-based, 4 training-based) across multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA scenarios, and introduces Bias-Free Score metric.

Result: Systematic comparison of debiasing performance across key dimensions: prompting vs training paradigm, model size, and generalization of training strategies to unseen bias types.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a unified testbed for bias mitigation research and will be publicly released to enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods.

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER is a new translation quality assessment metric using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that achieves state-of-the-art performance in WMT24 Metrics Shared Task through systematic step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing automated translation metrics by leveraging the explicit reasoning capabilities of LRMs for more accurate and interpretable translation quality assessment.

Method: Uses structured prompting templates with Large Reasoning Models (specifically OpenAI's o3 model) to conduct systematic step-by-step evaluation of translation quality, with varying reasoning efforts tested.

Result: Achieved highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free settings at system level, and top-performing among reference-free approaches at segment level in WMT24 evaluation.

Conclusion: Large Reasoning Models represent a measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first open-source RAG pipeline for Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs), showing consistent performance improvements over non-RAG baselines across three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the growing interest in generative ELMs and the proven benefits of RAG in LLMs, there is no existing open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline design specifically for ELMs.

Method: Developed an open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs with baselines and ablation studies for natural language generation, tested on three public datasets.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ELMs with RAG consistently outperform non-RAG baselines and reveal important ELM design considerations.

Conclusion: The presented RAG pipeline successfully addresses the gap in ELM research, providing an open-source solution that improves performance and offers valuable insights for future ELM development.

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

### [9] [Judging with Confidence: Calibrating Autoraters to Preference Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00263)
*Zhuohang Li,Xiaowei Li,Chengyu Huang,Guowang Li,Katayoon Goshvadi,Bo Dai,Dale Schuurmans,Paul Zhou,Hamid Palangi,Yiwen Song,Palash Goyal,Murat Kantarcioglu,Bradley A. Malin,Yuan Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to model full preference distributions rather than discrete labels, addressing subjectivity and ambiguity in LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM autoraters trained on discrete preference labels fail to capture subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced tasks, limiting their reliability for human value alignment.

Method: Two learning methods: 1) supervised fine-tuning for dense probabilistic labels, and 2) reinforcement learning for sparse binary labels, both using distribution-matching objectives.

Result: Fine-tuned autoraters show better alignment with target preference distributions, improved calibration, significantly lower positional bias, while maintaining performance on objective tasks.

Conclusion: Modeling full preference distributions through calibrated probabilistic autoraters improves reliability in LLM alignment compared to discrete label approaches.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

### [10] [Efficient Layer-wise LLM Fine-tuning for Revision Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00268)
*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that dynamically selects important LLM layers for text revision classification, achieving better performance with less data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are underutilized for text classification tasks, especially nuanced tasks like text revision classification, due to expensive annotation requirements and their generation-focused pre-training.

Method: A plug-and-play layer-wise PEFT framework that fine-tunes only important LLM layers selected based on gradient norm distribution, while freezing redundant layers.

Result: IR-Tuning outperforms other layer-wise PEFT methods across diverse text revision tasks, with fast convergence, low GPU memory usage, and effectiveness on small datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed IR-Tuning framework provides an efficient solution for adapting LLMs to nuanced text classification tasks with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

### [11] [SafePassage: High-Fidelity Information Extraction with Black Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00276)
*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage is a three-step pipeline that reduces hallucinations in LLM-based information extraction by generating grounded "safe passages" and verifying extraction consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black box LLMs make IE easy to configure but hard to trust, as extracted information is not guaranteed to be grounded in documents, leading to hallucinations.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) LLM extractor generates entities and contexts, (2) string-based global aligner, (3) scoring model to verify consistency between extracted info and document.

Result: Reduces hallucinations by up to 85% with minimal false positives; fine-tuned transformer encoder outperforms LLM scoring model; annotations can be collected in 1-2 hours.

Conclusion: SafePassage effectively reduces hallucinations in LLM-based IE and can dually serve as an evaluation method, with task-specific fine-tuning providing better performance than LLM scoring.

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ruochen Li,Jun Li,Bailiang Jian,Kun Yuan,Youxiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework to address the gap between automated radiology report evaluation metrics and clinical trust, revealing limitations in current metrics' ability to assess clinical significance and semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated radiology report evaluation metrics receive high scores but fail to earn clinicians' trust, revealing fundamental flaws in how these metrics assess report quality.

Method: Proposed a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework with criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities (discrimination, robustness, monotonicity), using a fine-grained dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types, clinical significance labels, and explanations.

Result: Systematic evaluation revealed existing metrics' limitations: failing to distinguish clinically significant errors, over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error severity levels.

Conclusion: The framework provides guidance for building more clinically reliable evaluation methods that better align with clinical practice and trust requirements.

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

*Ľuboš Kriš,Jaroslav Kopčan,Qiwei Peng,Andrej Ridzik,Marcel Veselý,Martin Tamajka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: o-mega is a hyperparameter optimization tool that automatically identifies the most effective explainable AI methods and configurations for transformer-based language models in semantic matching tasks, particularly for fact-checking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of transformer-based language models has created challenges in model transparency and trustworthiness, with numerous explanation methods and evaluation metrics making it difficult to select optimal explainability approaches.

Method: Developed o-mega, a hyperparameter optimization tool that systematically explores different explainable AI methods and their configurations within the semantic matching domain, evaluated on a post-claim matching pipeline using social media posts paired with refuting claims.

Result: The tool demonstrates improved transparency in automated fact-checking systems by automatically identifying the most effective explainability methods and configurations.

Conclusion: Automated optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications like misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

### [14] [CORTEX: Collaborative LLM Agents for High-Stakes Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00311)
*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX is a multi-agent LLM architecture that uses specialized agents to collaboratively triage security alerts, reducing false positives and improving investigation quality compared to single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC analysts face alert fatigue from thousands of daily alerts, with classical detection pipelines being brittle and single-agent LLM approaches struggling with noisy enterprise data and lacking transparency.

Method: A multi-agent LLM architecture with specialized agents: behavior-analysis agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into auditable decisions.

Result: CORTEX substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs across diverse enterprise scenarios.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM architectures with specialized agents collaborating over real evidence provide more effective and transparent alert triage solutions for SOCs compared to single-agent approaches.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

### [15] [TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444)
*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem introduces tokenized procedural memory that stores procedures as compact embeddings, enabling efficient reuse without repeated prompt reading and outperforming retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently rely on prompts that must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack modular reuse mechanisms for procedures.

Method: TokMem stores recurring procedures as trainable embeddings where each memory token encodes both procedure address and control signal, keeping backbone model frozen for continual adaptation.

Result: Outperforms retrieval-augmented generation on 1,000 atomic recall tasks and compositional function-calling tasks while avoiding repeated context overhead and using fewer parameters than fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TokMem provides a scalable, modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by offering explicit procedural memory for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for

generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip is a plug-and-play code compression framework for code LLMs that uses dual-stage compression to reduce context size while maintaining performance, achieving up to 5.6x compression ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation under long contexts is critical but faces bottlenecks from high API costs and generation latency. Existing context pruning techniques work well for general text but overlook code-specific structures, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks.

Method: LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; (2) fine-grained compression segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance.

Result: Evaluations across multiple tasks (code completion, summarization, question answering) show LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

### [17] [Enhancing Rating Prediction with Off-the-Shelf LLMs Using In-Context User Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00449)
*Koki Ryu,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using off-the-shelf LLMs for Likert-scale rating prediction, finding that user-written reviews significantly improve performance, comparable to traditional methods like matrix factorization, and that prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews further enhances results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM personalization research has focused on classification/ranking tasks, Likert-scale rating prediction (a regression task requiring both language and mathematical reasoning) remains underexplored despite significant industrial applications, particularly regarding off-the-shelf LLM capabilities.

Method: Conducted comprehensive experiments with eight LLM models across three datasets, testing different in-context information including user-written reviews, general preference descriptions, and prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews before rating prediction.

Result: User-written reviews significantly improve LLM rating prediction performance, achieving results comparable to traditional matrix factorization methods. Concrete item reviews are more effective than general preference descriptions. Prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews first further enhances prediction performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential as a solution for cold-start problems in rating prediction, with user-written reviews being particularly effective, and the hypothetical review generation technique providing additional performance improvements.

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent fine-tuning improves LLM performance in specialized technical domains like Hitachi's JP1 middleware, achieving 14% better results on certification exams compared to base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of few-shot prompting in agentic LLMs (lengthy inputs, high computational costs) and explore the effectiveness of agent fine-tuning in specialized technical microdomains where general approaches may not work well.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets from domain manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves. Used retrieval-augmented generation with a context-answer extractor during inference to improve information relevance.

Result: Achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base model on JP1 certification exam questions, demonstrating enhanced decision making accuracy and search efficiency.

Conclusion: Agent fine-tuning shows significant potential for domain-specific reasoning in complex microdomains, enabling LLMs to internalize procedural reasoning and specialized knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

*Pengzhou Cheng,Lingzhong Dong,Zeng Wu,Zongru Wu,Xiangru Tang,Chengwei Qin,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-ScanKit is a probing framework that reveals multimodal GUI agents rely more on memorization than systematic reasoning, showing limited generalization in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal agents for GUI interaction show limited reliability on complex or out-of-domain tasks, raising concerns about whether they perform spurious reasoning rather than genuine understanding.

Method: Proposed Agent-ScanKit framework with three orthogonal probing paradigms (visual-guided, text-guided, structure-guided) to quantify memorization vs reasoning contributions without accessing model internals.

Result: Evaluation on 5 GUI benchmarks with 18 multimodal agents shows mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic reasoning, with models functioning mainly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge with limited generalization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for robust reasoning modeling in multimodal agents for real-world scenarios and provide insights for developing more reliable agents.

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech is a speech-to-speech large language model that directly processes and generates speech without text intermediates, using modality-based layer-splitting and frozen pre-training to maintain text LLM capabilities while adding native speech understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech systems use cascaded pipelines that discard paralinguistic cues and limit expressivity. Current end-to-end methods still rely on text intermediates, creating a fundamental bottleneck for true speech-to-speech communication.

Method: Combines modality-based layer-splitting architecture with frozen pre-training strategy, preserving reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech capabilities without text guidance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering, delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance to text-guided systems, and maintains competitive text performance.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction by narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph2Eval is a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates multimodal document comprehension and web interaction tasks to comprehensively evaluate agent capabilities in reasoning, collaboration, and interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are inadequate for evaluating agent tasks requiring tool use and interactive capabilities, and current automatic agent task generation approaches are limited to text/image analysis without systematic modeling of multi-step web interactions.

Method: Knowledge graphs from multi-source external data serve as task space, with semantic relations translated into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline ensures task quality and executability.

Result: Graph2Eval-Bench dataset with 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show the framework efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent/model performance and reveal capability gaps.

Conclusion: Graph2Eval offers a new perspective for agent evaluation by enabling comprehensive assessment of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities across different agent types and settings.

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM improves contextual faithfulness in RAG systems by training LLMs to generate high-copying responses from provided context, reducing hallucinations through increased contextual trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of contextual faithfulness in RAG systems where LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability.

Method: Two-stage high-copying response preference training with three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, creating an automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data.

Result: CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance on FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements over best baseline on FaithEval, using only 365 training samples (1/50th of baseline data).

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM recalibrates LLM reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation, effectively improving contextual faithfulness with minimal training data.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

TL;DR: First systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models, showing high success rates across multiple encoders and tasks, with proposed fine-tuning defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs inherit vulnerabilities from their components, and audio backdoor attacks pose a significant security threat to speech language models.

Method: Conducted systematic audio backdoor attacks across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering ASR, speech emotion recognition, gender and age prediction tasks. Performed component-wise analysis to identify vulnerable pipeline stages.

Result: Attack consistently achieved high success rates ranging from 90.76% to 99.41% across all tested configurations.

Conclusion: Audio backdoors pose serious security risks to speech language models, and fine-tuning-based defense can mitigate threats from poisoned pretrained encoders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual speech datasets have insufficient data for most languages, leading to poor model performance on the majority of supported languages.

Method: A scalable pipeline with robust media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio from parliamentary recordings.

Result: Extracted over 61k hours of aligned speech segments from 22 European parliaments, with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours. Achieved 41.8% average reduction in word error rates when finetuning existing ASR models.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in multilingual speech processing by leveraging parliamentary recordings, providing substantial high-quality speech data that significantly improves ASR performance across multiple languages.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

*Gaotang Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Xiusi Chen,Heng Ji,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the standard negative log likelihood (NLL) objective in supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, proposing that different probability-based objectives perform better depending on model capability levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT using NLL shows limited generalization, likely because post-training violates NLL's optimality assumptions when models already have task-relevant priors and supervision is noisy.

Method: Study a family of probability-based objectives and evaluate them across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, analyzing performance along the model-capability continuum.

Result: Prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens outperform NLL for strong models, NLL dominates for weak models, and no single objective prevails for intermediate models.

Conclusion: Objective effectiveness depends on model capability, providing a principled foundation for adapting training objectives to specific model strengths.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV is a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies in GUI interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents face inefficiency challenges due to processing long sequences of high-resolution screenshots, making inference slow and memory-bound. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they don't account for GUI-specific spatial and temporal redundancies.

Method: GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: spatial saliency guidance (augmenting attention scores with L2 norm of hidden states) and temporal redundancy scoring (projecting previous frames' keys onto current frame's key subspace to prune redundant history). Uses uniform budget allocation based on analysis showing uniform attention sparsity across transformer layers.

Result: Outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. In 5-screenshot setting on AgentNetBench, reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over full-cache baseline.

Conclusion: Exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance. The method requires no retraining and demonstrates that simple uniform budget allocation outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes for GUI workloads.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

TL;DR: Small reasoning models often overthink during tool use, reaching correct configurations then overwriting them. ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic, monitors log-probability margins to trigger early termination, improving accuracy while reducing tokens by up to 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small reasoning models exhibit overthinking behavior during tool use, where they reach correct tool-argument configurations but continue reasoning and overwrite them with incorrect calls. This reveals substantial recoverable headroom and potential redundant reasoning.

Method: Diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that inject </think> at sentence boundaries. Adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and introduce ThinkBrake - a training-free decoding heuristic that monitors the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at sentence boundaries, triggering termination when this margin becomes small.

Result: Oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8% to 94.2% while reducing tokens by 80-94%. ThinkBrake preserves or improves accuracy across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits while reducing tokens up to 25%, outperforming various baselines.

Conclusion: ThinkBrake effectively addresses overthinking in small reasoning models during tool use, providing a practical solution that improves accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead through early termination.

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or

TL;DR: CHIME is a Chinese Internet meme dataset for evaluating LLMs' understanding of viral online content. Results show LLMs struggle with culturally nuanced memes and identifying origins, performing below human levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models truly understand viral internet content (memes) that they're trained on, particularly culturally specific Chinese memes.

Method: Created CHIME dataset with popular Chinese phrase-based memes annotated with meanings, origins, examples, and types. Designed two evaluation tasks: 1) meme explanation and origin identification, 2) multiple-choice questions selecting appropriate memes for contextual sentences.

Result: LLMs can explain some meme meanings but performance drops significantly for culturally nuanced types. They consistently fail to provide accurate origins. In multiple-choice tasks, models perform better but still below human levels.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited understanding of culturally specific internet memes, particularly struggling with origins and nuanced cultural contexts. The CHIME dataset enables future research on computational meme understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

### [30] [ReSeek: A Self-Correcting Framework for Search Agents with Instructive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00568)
*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSeek is a self-correcting framework for training LLM-based search agents that introduces a JUDGE action for dynamic error recovery and uses dense process rewards to improve reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, leading to commitment to suboptimal reasoning paths without recovery ability.

Method: Proposes ReSeek framework with self-correction mechanism using JUDGE action, dense instructive process rewards (correctness + utility), and introduces FictionalHot benchmark to avoid data contamination.

Result: Agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.

Conclusion: ReSeek provides an effective self-correcting framework that enables search agents to dynamically recover from errors and achieve better performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

*Li Li,Ziyi Wang,Yongliang Wu,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT Vectors are compact representations that encode multi-step reasoning knowledge, addressing the cost and inefficiency of existing Chain-of-Thought methods while achieving comparable performance to parameter-efficient fine-tuning with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Chain-of-Thought reasoning at lower cost and address the limitations of expensive implementations like in-context learning and fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed CoT Vectors (both Extracted and Learnable versions) using task vector paradigm, with Learnable CoT Vectors optimized under teacher-student framework to address layer-wise instability.

Result: CoT Vectors outperform existing baselines, achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods with fewer trainable parameters, and reveal insights about LLM reasoning through layer-wise analysis.

Conclusion: CoT Vectors provide an efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities while offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first syllabification work for the Tenyidie language using deep learning models, achieving 99.21% accuracy with BLSTM on a newly created dataset of 10,120 syllabified words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie is a low-resource Tibeto-Burman language with no prior NLP research on syllabification, despite its importance for various NLP tasks like morphological analysis and machine translation.

Method: Created a corpus of 10,120 syllabified Tenyidie words and applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures with 80:10:10 train:validation:test split.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set, demonstrating effective syllabification for this low-resource language.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational resources for Tenyidie NLP applications and shows deep learning's effectiveness for syllabification in low-resource languages.

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MCM-DPO method for alt-text generation that learns from preference pairs without precise annotations, outperforming DPO and SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in alt-text generation caused by noisy user annotations, inconsistent standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to context, where SFT struggles due to flawed target annotations.

Method: Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO) that optimizes preferences across single, paired, and multi-preference dimensions covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.

Result: MCM-DPO consistently outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing new state-of-the-art in alt-text generation. Created two large-scale datasets (TAlt and PAlt) with 202k annotated samples and 18k preference pairs.

Conclusion: MCM-DPO effectively improves alt-text generation by learning from preference pairs without requiring precise annotations, and the released datasets support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

*François Ledoyen,Gaël Dias,Jeremie Pantin,Alexis Lechervy,Fabrice Maurel,Youssef Chahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) to automate Easy-to-Read (ETR) content generation through multi-task learning approaches, showing improved performance over single-task methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of Easy-to-Read texts for neurodivergent individuals is time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Proposed multi-task learning approach combining text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. Explored two strategies: multi-task RAG for in-context learning and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B models.

Result: Multi-task setups outperformed single-task baselines across all configurations. RAG-based strategy enabled generalization in out-of-domain settings, while MTL-LoRA performed best in in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning approaches effectively automate ETR content generation, with different strategies offering complementary benefits for in-domain and out-of-domain performance.

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ETR-fr, the first dataset for Easy-to-Read text generation compliant with European guidelines, and establishes generative baselines using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual Easy-to-Read text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to scale, limiting access to crucial information for individuals with cognitive impairments. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces challenges including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing lightweight learning of LLMs.

Method: Introduced ETR-fr dataset fully compliant with European ETR guidelines; implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs; developed evaluation framework using automatic metrics and human assessments with a 36-question evaluation form aligned with guidelines.

Result: PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to out-of-domain texts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs can achieve comparable performance to LLMs for ETR text generation, providing an effective and accessible solution for scaling Easy-to-Read content creation.

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a

TL;DR: ALARB is a dataset of 13K Saudi commercial court cases for evaluating Arabic LLMs' legal reasoning, including verdict prediction, reasoning chain completion, and regulation identification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arabic benchmarks lack focus on multistep reasoning in legal contexts, especially open-ended reasoning tasks for Arabic LLMs.

Method: Created dataset with court cases containing facts, reasoning, verdicts, and cited clauses; defined legal reasoning tasks; benchmarked Arabic LLMs and performed instruction tuning.

Result: Instruction-tuning a 12B parameter model with ALARB significantly improved verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ALARB effectively evaluates and enhances Arabic LLMs' legal reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of domain-specific instruction tuning.

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

*Jenny Kunz,Iben Nyholm Debess,Annika Simonsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper adapts small LLMs to Faroese language through transfer learning from related Scandinavian languages, comparing different tuning methods and evaluating performance on linguistic accuracy and comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting language models to low-resource languages like Faroese, leveraging transfer learning from related higher-resource Scandinavian languages.

Method: Start from English models, continue pre-training on Scandinavian languages (individually or combined via merging), then fine-tune on Faroese using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient LoRA tuning.

Result: Transfer from related languages is crucial but task-dependent: Icelandic improves linguistic accuracy while Danish boosts comprehension. LoRA enhances linguistic acceptability and human evaluation scores, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension and better preserves model capabilities.

Conclusion: The optimal adaptation strategy for low-resource languages depends on the specific task, with different source languages and tuning methods providing complementary benefits for linguistic accuracy versus comprehension performance.

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

TL;DR: REAL-MT systems degrade under noisy retrieval, especially for low-resource languages. Large reasoning models rationalize errors and show poor calibration. Training-free and fine-tuning methods improve robustness but trade off clean-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding REAL-MT reliability under noisy retrieval, which is common in real-world deployment but poorly studied.

Method: Proposed a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to systematically evaluate REAL-MT robustness. Used Qwen-series models (standard LLMs and LRMs) on idiomatic translation across language pairs with synthesized noise.

Result: Low-resource language pairs degrade more severely under noise. LRMs show no error correction improvement and are more susceptible to noise, rationalizing incorrect contexts. Attention shifts from source to noisy content while confidence increases despite accuracy decline.

Conclusion: Current approaches have limitations, highlighting the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms. Training-free and fine-tuning strategies improve robustness but reveal a fundamental trade-off with clean-context performance.

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

*Adi Simhi,Jonathan Herzig,Martin Tutek,Itay Itzhak,Idan Szpektor,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManagerBench is a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic managerial scenarios where models must choose between pragmatic but harmful actions and safe but operationally worse actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks focus on preventing harmful text generation but overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when operational goals conflict with human safety.

Method: Created ManagerBench with human-validated managerial scenarios that force choices between pragmatic but harmful actions and safe actions, plus a parallel control set to measure pragmatism.

Result: Frontier LLMs perform poorly in safety-pragmatism trade-off - many choose harmful options for operational goals, while others become overly safe and ineffective. Misalignment stems from flawed prioritization, not inability to perceive harm.

Conclusion: ManagerBench addresses a critical gap in evaluating agentic behavior where operational goals and alignment values conflict, revealing significant safety challenges in autonomous LLM agents.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

TL;DR: ESearch uses Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL) to improve multi-hop reasoning in LLMs by identifying and correcting faulty reasoning steps, achieving significant performance gains over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs struggle with complex multi-hop reasoning due to decomposition errors, retrieval missing, and reasoning errors that propagate through the chain.

Method: Proposed Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework that identifies faulty reasoning steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place to prevent error propagation.

Result: ESearch models achieved substantial improvements: 3B model +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, 7B model +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over SOTA on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.

Conclusion: Erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs, transforming fragile reasoning into a resilient process.

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard is a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model that mitigates hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation by classifying document-claim pairs and providing evidence-grounded justifications, achieving competitive performance with larger models while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are prone to hallucinations, which limits their trustworthiness in real-world applications. There is a need for specialized models that can effectively detect and mitigate hallucinations in RAG systems.

Method: Combines: (i) domain-agnostic synthetic dataset from FineWeb with multi-stage curation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning using Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone.

Result: On RAGTruth subset: 84.0% balanced accuracy, rivaling MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%). On full benchmark: 75.7% BAcc, matching GPT-4o (75.9%). Achieves competitive performance with roughly half the parameters of specialized models.

Conclusion: HalluGuard demonstrates that small reasoning models can effectively mitigate hallucinations in RAG systems while maintaining transparency through evidence-grounded justifications, offering a parameter-efficient alternative to larger specialized and general-purpose models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing AI text detection methods that neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and fail to generalize across disciplines and generators in scientific writing.

Method: Combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning, integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration for precise span-level detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36 on cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000 annotated samples from multiple LLM families.

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet demonstrates strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

*Shunfeng Zheng,Yudi Zhang,Meng Fang,Zihan Zhang,Zhitan Wu,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhoPile, a multimodal dataset for Olympiad-level physics problems, and benchmarks retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models on physics reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of RAG in enhancing expert-level physics reasoning in foundation models, inspired by how students review past problems for competitions.

Method: Created PhoPile dataset with diagrams, graphs, and equations; benchmarked RAG-augmented LLMs and LMMs with multiple retrievers on physics reasoning tasks.

Result: Integration of retrieval with physics corpora improves model performance, but challenges remain that need further research.

Conclusion: RAG shows promise for enhancing physics reasoning in foundation models, though more work is needed to address existing challenges in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fusion-of-N (FusioN) is a collaborative method that synthesizes the best elements from multiple LLM generations using a judge model, outperforming traditional Best-of-N selection approach in both test-time scaling and synthetic data generation across diverse tasks and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Best-of-N approach discards valuable information from diverse generations by selecting only one winner. The authors aim to leverage all candidates collaboratively to create better final outputs.

Method: Propose Fusion-of-N (FusioN) that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most informative elements from each sample in a pool into a single final answer. Applied in two settings: test-time scaling (sampling from single model) and synthetic data generation (fusing samples from diverse teachers).

Result: FusioN consistently outperforms BoN across 11 languages, 3 diverse tasks and varying model scales. Shows versatility and robustness in both test-time scaling and downstream gains from synthetic data generation. Demonstrates surprising strengths under challenging settings.

Conclusion: Should shift from monolithic quality measurement to embracing polylithic nature of LLM generations. This allows integrating diverse strengths, unlocking latent potential, and achieving improvements inaccessible through selection alone.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show up to 20% accuracy reduction when processing non-standard American English dialects, with three specific grammar rules (existential 'it', zero copula, and y'all) explaining most performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLM performance degradation for under-represented English dialects and identify specific grammatical structures causing bias.

Method: Analyzed effects of converting standard American English questions to non-standard dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks, examining individual grammatical rules' impact.

Result: Found up to 20% reduction in accuracy for non-standard dialects, with three grammar rules (existential 'it', zero copula, and y'all) explaining majority of performance degradation across multiple dialects.

Conclusion: Future bias mitigation should focus on individual, high-impact grammatical structures rather than treating dialects as monolithic entities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A syntax-guided diffusion language model that enhances text quality, diversity, and controllability by integrating structural supervision and personalized conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce generic text with insufficient structural diversity, limiting personalized expression. Diffusion models offer opportunities to improve language generation beyond autoregressive limitations.

Method: Proposes a cascaded framework generating syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and a noncascaded architecture for better structure-content alignment. Uses shared representation mechanism for fine-grained personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Qualitative analyses highlight interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed syntax-guided diffusion model effectively captures lexical and structural characteristics, enabling better personalized text generation with improved quality and controllability.

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network decision-making processes by uncovering mechanisms and identifying roles of model components like neurons, attention heads, and sparse features from SAEs.

Method: Survey methodology analyzing key methods for generating concept descriptions, evolving evaluation metrics (automated and human), and supporting datasets in the field.

Result: Synthesis reveals growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation of concept descriptions for model components and abstractions.

Conclusion: Provides roadmap for future research toward making models more transparent by outlining state of the art and identifying key challenges in concept description generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid DST model combining rule-based methods with language models (BERT, XGBoost, GPT) for Persian multi-turn dialogues, showing improved accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based DST is inefficient for open-domain, multi-turn chatbots due to lack of adaptability and coherence in complex conversations.

Method: Hybrid DST model using rule-based methods with BERT for slot filling/intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST, and online agents for real-time answers.

Result: Significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing methods on Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach effectively improves DST capabilities, enabling more customized, adaptable, and human-like conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzes ASR research for African low-resource languages, finding limited datasets, reproducibility issues, and inadequate evaluation metrics despite promising self-supervised learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African low-resource languages are severely underrepresented in ASR research, creating barriers to digital inclusion across the continent with over 2000 languages.

Method: Conducted PRISMA 2020 systematic review of 2,062 records from DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and arXiv (2020-2025), screening 71 studies and analyzing 74 datasets across 111 languages.

Result: Found 11,206 hours of speech data but <15% reproducibility; self-supervised learning shows promise but limited by data scarcity; WER dominates evaluation with minimal use of linguistically appropriate metrics like CER/DER.

Conclusion: Sustainable ASR development requires stakeholder partnerships, ethical datasets, lightweight models, and active benchmarking to address current limitations in dataset availability, annotations, and evaluation methods.

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mR3 is a massively multilingual reward reasoning model covering 72 languages, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks while being significantly smaller than larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM judges work well in English but don't generalize effectively to non-English settings, and there's limited understanding of what makes effective multilingual training for such judges.

Method: Developed mR3 through comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection, including integration of target-language reasoning datasets, trained on 72 languages with broadest coverage in reward modeling.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (like GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, with effectiveness confirmed through extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: mR3 demonstrates successful multilingual reward modeling with broad language coverage, providing effective strategies for building high-quality reward models across multiple languages.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

### [53] [Pay-Per-Search Models are Abstention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01152)
*Mustafa Omer Gul,Claire Cardie,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASH is a training framework that enables LLMs to recognize their knowledge boundaries and selectively abstain from answering questions they cannot reliably answer, using search tool usage as a proxy for abstention through reinforcement learning with pay-per-search rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate answers to questions outside their knowledge boundaries, unlike humans who recognize their limitations and seek help or abstain. The goal is to develop a method that allows LLMs to reliably abstain from answering questions they cannot answer accurately.

Method: MASH uses reinforcement learning with a pay-per-search reward system, where external help-seeking (search tool use) serves as a proxy for abstention. The approach penalizes unnecessary search usage while rewarding answer accuracy, training LLMs to align search tool use with their parametric knowledge boundaries.

Result: On three knowledge-intensive QA datasets, MASH significantly improves selective help-seeking performance over prior approaches, achieving 7.6% higher answer accuracy on multi-hop datasets. It also demonstrates strong off-the-shelf abstention capability, distinguishing between answerable and unanswerable questions without requiring pre-defined knowledge boundaries.

Conclusion: MASH effectively aligns search tool usage with LLMs' parametric knowledge boundaries, enabling reliable abstention decisions as a by-product of training for selective help-seeking. This approach eliminates the need for pre-determining knowledge boundaries and provides a practical solution to reduce hallucinations in LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark to evaluate LLMs' allocation decisions, revealing that most models prioritize efficiency over fairness and their strategies are easily influenced by external factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for high-stakes societal decisions, but their underlying values and principles in resource allocation remain unexamined, creating potential risks.

Method: Developed a dynamic simulation environment where LLMs act as sovereign allocators distributing tasks to heterogeneous communities, creating trade-offs between efficiency (ROI) and fairness (Gini coefficient). Evaluated 20 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Three key findings: 1) General conversational ability doesn't predict allocation skill; 2) Most LLMs default to utilitarian orientation favoring productivity over equality; 3) Allocation strategies are vulnerable to output constraints and social framing.

Conclusion: Current LLMs pose risks as societal decision-makers, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a dynamic demonstration-based approach where an LLM is trained to generate input-specific concise demonstrations, outperforming traditional RAG methods under budget constraints and showing strong generalization to OOD domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG relies on static databases which constrain adaptability and can result in irrelevant demonstrations. There's a need for more dynamic, input-specific contextual support.

Method: Train an LLM to generate input-specific concise demonstrations. The approach works under budget constraints limiting both demonstration tokens and final output tokens. Smaller models can generate demonstrations to guide larger target models.

Result: GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions, showing robust generalization to OOD domains like physics, chemistry, and computer science.

Conclusion: GRAD introduces a scalable demonstration generator model as the first step toward dynamic few-shot learning in resource-constrained settings, reducing training costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies typicality bias in preference data as a fundamental cause of mode collapse in LLM alignment, and proposes Verbalized Sampling (VS) - a training-free prompting method that improves diversity without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity (mode collapse). Unlike prior work focusing on algorithmic limitations, this paper identifies a fundamental data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data where annotators systematically favor familiar text due to cognitive psychology findings.

Method: Introduces Verbalized Sampling (VS), a simple training-free prompting strategy that prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities").

Result: VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation. In creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. More capable models benefit more from VS.

Conclusion: The work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy (Verbalized Sampling) that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety.

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPHERE is a novel model editing method that uses hyperspherical energy regularization to stabilize neuron weight distributions during sequential editing, preventing catastrophic forgetting while enabling reliable knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need constant updates to stay current, but sequential editing often causes catastrophic forgetting and destabilizes representations. The authors hypothesize that maintaining hyperspherical uniformity of neuron weights can help models remain stable while accommodating new knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), which identifies a sparse space complementary to principal hyperspherical directions of pretrained weights and projects new knowledge onto it, minimizing perturbations to preserve prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while better preserving general model performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SPHERE provides a principled approach for reliable large-scale knowledge editing by maintaining hyperspherical energy stability, offering a lightweight alternative to full retraining that prevents catastrophic forgetting during sequential updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

### [58] [Methodological Framework for Quantifying Semantic Test Coverage in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00001)
*Noah Broestl,Adel Nasser Abdalla,Rajprakash Bale,Hersh Gupta,Max Struever*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A methodology to quantify semantic coverage of RAG test questions against documents using vector embeddings and clustering, providing coverage metrics and outlier detection to improve test comprehensiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation lacks systematic methods to ensure test questions adequately cover the knowledge base, leaving developers with blind spots in system performance assessment.

Method: Embed document chunks and test questions into unified vector space, calculate coverage metrics (proximity, content-weighted, multi-topic), and use outlier detection to filter irrelevant questions.

Result: Experimental evidence shows the framework effectively quantifies test coverage, identifies underrepresented content areas, and provides recommendations for generating high-value test questions.

Conclusion: Provides RAG developers with essential tools to build robust test suites, improving system reliability and extending to applications like identifying misaligned documents.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

*Ahmed A. Elhag,Arun Raja,Alex Morehead,Samuel M. Blau,Garrett M. Morris,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransIP is a Transformer-based inter-atomic potential model that achieves symmetry compliance through learned equivariance rather than hard-wired architectural constraints, matching state-of-the-art equivariant models while offering greater flexibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLIPs enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant architectures, which reduces flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. The goal is to develop a more flexible approach that achieves symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints.

Method: TransIP uses a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model and guides it to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing representations in the embedding space, trained on the diverse Open Molecules (OMol25) dataset.

Result: TransIP attains comparable performance to state-of-the-art equivariant baselines in machine-learning force fields. Compared to data augmentation baseline, it achieves 40% to 60% improvement across varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: Learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models, offering comparable performance with greater flexibility and scalability.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

### [60] [Rethinking RoPE Scaling in Quantized LLM: Theory, Outlier, and Channel-Band Analysis with Weight Rescaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00028)
*Ye Qiao,Haocheng Xu,Xiaofan Zhang,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the degradation in accuracy when combining RoPE position interpolation (PI) with post-training quantization (PTQ) for extending LLM context windows, and proposes Q-ROAR - a lightweight, interpolation-aware stabilization method that groups RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performs per-band scaling to address the coupled effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending context window support of LLMs is crucial for long-distance dependency tasks, but combining RoPE position interpolation with post-training quantization degrades accuracy due to various coupled effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, and outlier shifting.

Method: Proposes Q-ROAR (Quantization, RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling) - a weight-only, interpolation-aware method that groups RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performs lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights, guided by interpolation pressure and tail-inflation ratio diagnostics.

Result: Q-ROAR reduces model perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14% while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-ROAR method effectively addresses the accuracy degradation in PI+PTQ approaches through interpolation-aware stabilization, requiring no fine-tuning, architecture changes, or additional deployment overhead.

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DexBench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world diabetes management tasks, featuring 360,600 personalized questions across 7 task categories using data from 15,000 individuals, with evaluation across 5 key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in health benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical tasks, by creating a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically for patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes management.

Method: Compiled one month of time-series data from 15,000 individuals across three diabetes populations, including glucose traces from CGMs and behavioral logs, then generated 360,600 personalized questions across 7 task categories.

Result: Evaluation of 8 recent LLMs showed substantial variability across tasks and metrics, with no single model consistently outperforming others across all dimensions.

Conclusion: DexBench aims to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care by establishing this comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

### [62] [Linear Regression in p-adic metric spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00043)
*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for machine learning using p-adic metrics, which better capture hierarchical data structures compared to traditional Euclidean metrics. The key result shows that p-adic regression planes must pass through more data points than Euclidean counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning approaches use Euclidean metrics that fail to represent the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships in real-world data like taxonomies and grammatical structures.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, proving mathematical results about regression planes and polynomial approximation in these spaces.

Result: The main theorem proves that an n-dimensional plane minimizing p-adic distances to dataset points must pass through at least n+1 points, contrasting with Euclidean regression. This demonstrates p-adic metrics better align with hierarchical data's discrete nature.

Conclusion: P-adic metrics are fundamental for properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning, as they respect the discrete nature where interpolation between points is less meaningful than selecting actual observed points.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,Youssif Abuzied,Muhammad ElMahdy,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align is a federated learning framework that uses LLMs as universal feature extractors to handle heterogeneous tabular data across clients, eliminating the need for manual schema harmonization while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with heterogeneous tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation, especially in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: The framework serializes tabular records into text and uses pre-trained LLMs (DistilBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, ClinicalBERT) as universal feature extractors to create semantically aligned representations, supporting lightweight local classifiers under FedAvg protocol.

Result: The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on coronary heart disease prediction, achieving up to +0.25 improvement in F1-score and 65% reduction in communication cost, with graceful degradation under extreme schema divergence.

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align provides a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments, establishing LLMs as effective universal feature extractors for tabular data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated frame- work that leverages pre-trained
large language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records
are serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT,
ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations
that support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol.
This approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM- Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

*Sicong Liu,Weiye Wu,Xiangrui Xu,Teng Li,Bowen Pang,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey systematically analyzes the convergence of foundation models and AI agents, focusing on adaptive and resource-efficient systems for mobile and edge deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of foundation models and AI agents creates tension between growing model complexity and constrained deployment environments (memory, energy, bandwidth, latency), requiring systematic study of adaptive solutions.

Method: Systematic characterization of enabling techniques including elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications.

Result: Identified key challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Established unified perspective for scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI, highlighting future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

### [65] [Approximately Unimodal Likelihood Models for Ordinal Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00122)
*Ryoya Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes approximately unimodal likelihood models for ordinal regression to handle both unimodal and near-unimodal conditional probability distributions, addressing limitations of strict unimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world ordinal data exhibit both unimodal and non-unimodal conditional probability distributions, but existing unimodal likelihood models suffer from bias when dealing with non-unimodal distributions.

Method: Developed approximately unimodal likelihood models that can represent both unimodal CPDs and CPDs that are close to unimodal, providing more flexibility than strict unimodal models.

Result: Experimental verification shows that the proposed model is effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and ordinal regression tasks.

Conclusion: The approximately unimodal likelihood models successfully mitigate the bias of strict unimodal models while maintaining effectiveness for ordinal regression.

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scientific multi-task learner that can handle cross-discipline real-world scientific problems through language-guided scientific computing, aiming to match or exceed specialized models while maintaining generalization.

Method: Three key innovations: Theory-Experiment Learning paradigm aligning numerical data with theoretical text; Binary Patch Encoding replacing BPE tokenization; Monte Carlo Attention substituting traditional transformer architectures. Pretrained via next-word-prediction on cross-discipline scientific datasets mixed with general corpus.

Result: Achieved 100% accuracy in 50-digit arithmetic addition; performance on par with specialized models in particle physics jet tagging; matched MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation; comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction; benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling.

Conclusion: Language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning capabilities, with plans to scale pretraining to universe scale as a step toward developing material world foundational model.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text

Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific

MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning

*Adarsha Balaji,Sandeep Madireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NeurTransformer, a method to design transformer-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) for efficient inference by replacing self-attention with spike-based self-attention and fine-tuning with SNN learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have quadratic computational complexity with input sequence length, making training and deployment challenging. SNNs offer energy efficiency but existing conversion methods are inefficient and time-consuming.

Method: 1) Replace self-attention with spike-based self-attention (SSA), 2) Convert feed-forward blocks to SNN equivalents, 3) Fine-tune SSA block using SNN surrogate learning algorithms.

Result: Converted GPT-2 small models show 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and 9.7% reduction in perplexity. SSA block achieves 64.71%-85.28% energy reduction compared to standard self-attention on digital hardware.

Conclusion: NeurTransformer provides an effective methodology for creating energy-efficient transformer-based SNNs with minimal performance degradation, addressing computational challenges of traditional transformers.

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

*Yujia Zheng,Shaoan Xie,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for concept identifiability using comparison across diverse observations, providing correctness guarantees for concept learning without assuming specific concept types or parametric models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human learning through comparison of diverse observations enables compositional understanding and extrapolation. The authors argue this cognitive mechanism is crucial for machines to recover true concepts, addressing the lack of theoretical support in concept learning despite empirical successes.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for concept identifiability with multiple observation classes. Use comparison across diverse classes to identify hidden concepts without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models. Also consider local comparisons when global conditions aren't satisfied.

Result: Hidden concepts can be identified with sufficient diversity across observation classes. Even when conditions aren't globally satisfied, alternative guarantees can be provided for as many concepts as possible using local comparisons. The hidden structure between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework validates that comparison across diverse observations enables concept identifiability, extending applicability to flexible scenarios. Results are validated in both synthetic and real-world settings, providing theoretical foundations for concept learning.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

### [69] [Which Rewards Matter? Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning under Limited Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00144)
*Shreyas Chaudhari,Renhao Zhang,Philip S. Thomas,Bruno Castro da Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of limited reward feedback in reinforcement learning, proposing reward selection strategies to maximize policy performance with fewer labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical reinforcement learning often faces computational and financial constraints in obtaining large quantities of reward labels, especially when relying on human feedback, creating a need for efficient reward selection methods.

Method: The paper formalizes the Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning from Limited Feedback (RLLF) problem and investigates two types of strategies: (1) heuristics using reward-free information like state visitation and partial value functions, and (2) pre-trained strategies using auxiliary evaluative feedback.

Result: Effective reward selection methods can yield near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, with critical rewards being those that guide optimal trajectories and support recovery from deviations.

Conclusion: Reward selection is established as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings, enabling efficient learning with limited labeled samples.

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

### [70] [Partial Identification Approach to Counterfactual Fairness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00163)
*Saeyoung Rho,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating counterfactual fairness measures when they are not identifiable from available data, using partial identification to derive informative bounds on these measures from observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of AI decision-making systems in critical domains like criminal justice and hiring has raised concerns about algorithmic fairness, particularly when we only have access to algorithm outputs without understanding their internal mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness measures with high confidence, using partial identification to derive informative bounds from observational data.

Result: Application to the COMPAS dataset reveals a positive (spurious) effect on COMPAS scores when changing race to African-American and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian partial identification approach provides a practical solution for evaluating counterfactual fairness measures when they are not fully identifiable from available data, offering insights into algorithmic fairness in real-world applications.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

### [71] [Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00184)
*Xiaoyan Bai,Itamar Pres,Yuntian Deng,Chenhao Tan,Stuart Shieber,Fernanda Viégas,Martin Wattenberg,Andrew Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reverse-engineers how language models learn multi-digit multiplication through implicit chain-of-thought, revealing long-range dependency mechanisms and geometric representations that standard fine-tuning lacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why language models fail at multi-digit multiplication despite their capabilities, by studying a model that successfully learns this task.

Method: Reverse-engineering a model with implicit chain-of-thought using logit attributions, linear probes, and analyzing attention mechanisms to uncover long-range dependency structures.

Result: Found three key findings: (1) Model encodes long-range dependencies for multiplication, (2) Uses attention to build DAG for caching/retrieving partial products, (3) Implements partial products via Minkowski sums and Fourier basis representations.

Conclusion: Standard fine-tuning converges to local optima lacking required long-range dependencies, but introducing auxiliary loss for "running sum" prediction provides the right inductive bias to successfully learn multiplication.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

*Xin Yu,Cong Xie,Ziyu Zhao,Tiantian Fan,Lingzhou Xue,Zhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA is a new framework that uses structured pruning to create highly representative low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces, outperforming standard LoRA and its variants across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning, and there's a need to obtain expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces more effectively.

Method: PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning using gradient-based structured pruning strategy, preventing their reactivation and enabling flexible rank allocation.

Result: Empirically outperforms LoRA and its variants across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding tasks, and shows advantages over existing structured pruning methods.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA provides a theoretically grounded and empirically effective approach for obtaining better low-rank adapters through structured pruning, with proven robustness advantages over activation-based pruning.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

*Prasanna Parthasarathi,Mathieu Reymond,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO-λ is an extension of GRPO that improves credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for reasoning tasks using λ-return and eligibility traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO lacks explicit reward or critic model, limiting its ability to assign fine-grained credit across token sequences in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Approximates λ-return learning with reformulated eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities and critic-free TD error approximation, with variations for λ-return weighting.

Result: 30-40% improved performance during RL training on LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 architectures; 3+ points average improvement on math reasoning benchmarks, with 4.5 points on 7B model.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ significantly outperforms GRPO in RL finetuning for complex reasoning tasks through better credit assignment mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RouterArena is the first open platform for comprehensive comparison of LLM routers, featuring a principled dataset, difficulty levels, extensive metrics, and automated leaderboard updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid emergence of various LLM routers makes choosing the right one challenging, necessitating a standardized comparison platform similar to model leaderboards.

Method: Built RouterArena with a principled dataset covering broad knowledge domains, distinguishable difficulty levels, extensive evaluation metrics, and automated framework for leaderboard updates.

Result: Produced initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1, demonstrating the platform's capability for comprehensive router evaluation.

Conclusion: RouterArena addresses the need for standardized LLM router comparison and will be made publicly available to help users select optimal models for different scenarios.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

*Zhanda Zhu,Qidong Su,Yaoyao Ding,Kevin Song,Shang Wang,Gennady Pekhimenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion is an efficient LoRA fine-tuning system that addresses runtime overhead and multi-adapter inefficiencies through fused kernels and adaptive batching, achieving up to 1.96x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA systems have redundant memory accesses and miss opportunities for concurrent multi-adapter fine-tuning, leading to performance inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes graph-splitting method to fuse memory-bound operations and adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning with bin-packing optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 1.96x end-to-end speedup over Megatron-LM and 1.46x improvement over mLoRA, with kernel performance improvements up to 1.39x.

Conclusion: LoRAFusion effectively addresses LoRA inefficiencies through kernel fusion and intelligent scheduling, providing significant performance gains for multi-adapter fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

*Yang Zhang,Huiwen Yan,Mushuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Directed-MAML is a novel meta-RL algorithm that improves upon MAML by using task-directed approximation to reduce computational overhead and accelerate convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML faces challenges in meta-RL due to high computational costs from second-order gradients and complex nested optimization that hinders convergence to global optimum.

Method: Directed-MAML applies first-order task-directed approximation before second-order gradient steps to estimate gradient effects, reducing computation and improving convergence.

Result: Directed-MAML outperforms MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence speed on CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2, and two-vehicle intersection crossing tasks.

Conclusion: Task-directed approximation can be effectively integrated into various meta-learning algorithms like FOMAML and Meta-SGD to enhance computational efficiency and convergence speed.

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

*Houjun Liu,Shikhar Murty,Christopher D. Manning,Róbert Csordás*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles is a transformer variant that enables parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams, allowing tokens requiring more computation to form 'bubbles' for additional thinking during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scaling inference-time compute rely on explicit chain-of-thought tokens, which cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to natural-language verbalization. Thoughtbubbles aims to enable adaptive computation learned during pretraining itself.

Method: Thoughtbubbles transformers learn to fork or delete residual streams in latent space, creating 'bubbles' where tokens can undergo additional parallel computation. This behavior is learned during pretraining using only language modeling loss.

Result: Thoughtbubbles outperforms standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity, and in zero-shot evaluations like HellaSwag and LAMBADA across 150M to 772M parameter scales.

Conclusion: The implicit nature of Thoughtbubbles enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, unifying train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

*Tsubasa Takahashi,Shojiro Yamabe,Futa Waseda,Kento Sasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differential Attention (DA) improves focus on clean inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability due to negative gradient alignment, creating a trade-off between selectivity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the structural fragility of Differential Attention under adversarial perturbations, identifying the root cause of its increased sensitivity compared to standard attention.

Method: Theoretical analysis of negative gradient alignment in DA's subtractive structure, empirical validation on ViT/DiffViT and pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP across five datasets, and depth-dependent experiments.

Result: DA shows higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, stronger local sensitivity, and a robustness crossover where deeper layers attenuate small perturbations but fail under larger attacks.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental trade-off between DA's improved discriminative focus and increased adversarial vulnerability, highlighting the need for joint design of selectivity and robustness in attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

*Alex Chen,Renato Geh,Aditya Grover,Guy Van den Broeck,Daniel Israel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV cache compression improves throughput but can cause certain instructions to be ignored, especially in multi-instruction scenarios. System prompt leakage is a key issue affected by compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the real-world consequences of KV cache compression in multi-instruction prompting scenarios, identifying pitfalls that practitioners should be aware of when deploying compressed LLMs.

Method: Analyzed KV cache compression effects on instruction following, particularly system prompt leakage. Examined factors like compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias. Proposed simple changes to KV cache eviction policies.

Result: Found that certain instructions degrade rapidly with compression and can be completely ignored. System prompt leakage is significantly affected by compression, with specific factors influencing the extent of leakage.

Conclusion: KV cache compression has hidden risks in multi-instruction scenarios. Simple modifications to eviction policies can mitigate these issues and improve overall performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me is a modular data poisoning attack for RAG systems that uses reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions, enabling scalable attacks with near-zero cost adaptation to new targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data poisoning attacks on RAG systems require costly optimization for each target phrase, making them poorly scalable.

Method: Decomposes adversarial documents into reusable Attention Attractors (optimized to direct attention) and Focus Regions (for semantic baits or malicious instructions), steering specific attention heads correlated with attack success.

Result: Achieves 57.8% average attack success rate across 18 RAG settings (+35.9 points, 2.6× improvement over prior work), with single optimized attractors transferring to unseen black box systems without retraining.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable RAG data poisoning paradigm, reveals practical threat from modular reusable components, and shows strong link between attention concentration and model outputs.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

TL;DR: DIANO is a differentiable autoencoding neural operator framework that creates interpretable latent spaces for scientific machine learning, enabling dimensional and geometric reduction while enforcing governing equations directly in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific machine learning methods struggle with interpretability in latent spaces, despite advances in dimensionality reduction for spatiotemporal flow data.

Method: DIANO uses neural operators to compress high-dimensional inputs through spatial coarsening (encoding) and reconstruct through spatial refinement (decoding), with an integrated differentiable PDE solver in the latent space.

Result: DIANO outperforms baseline models in latent space interpretability and dimensionality reduction, successfully solving PDEs in latent spaces for various flow problems including 2D cylinder flow and 3D patient-specific coronary arteries.

Conclusion: DIANO provides a framework for physically interpretable latent spaces that enable both dimensional and geometric reduction while embedding physical priors through differentiable PDE solving capabilities.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that computing per-example gradient statistics is feasible in AD frameworks with minimal overhead, enabling new optimization algorithm designs and analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning treats mini-batches as single objects, averaging gradients and potentially missing valuable per-example gradient information that could improve optimization.

Method: Proposes AD graph surgery techniques to compute gradient statistics efficiently, and uses JAX's vectorization for prototyping. Analyzes signSGD placement and per-example Adam preconditioner variations.

Result: Found that optimal signSGD placement can be predicted by signal-to-noise ratio, and that Adam preconditioner works best when dominated by gradient mean rather than variance - contrary to conventional wisdom.

Conclusion: Per-example gradient information enables new optimization analyses and algorithm designs, challenging traditional approaches to gradient processing.

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

### [83] [Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237)
*Xiaofeng Lin,Hejian Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT can achieve strong generalization comparable to RL when trained with prompt diversity and chain-of-thought supervision, challenging the view that SFT inherently memorizes data while RL generalizes better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing view that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness.

Method: Systematic evaluation on Sokoban and General Points benchmarks using prompt diversity during training and chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision as algorithmic scaffold.

Result: SFT with prompt diversity achieves strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. CoT supervision improves transfer to more difficult regimes. Combining both approaches matches or surpasses RL baselines while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.

Conclusion: SFT is not inherently inferior to RL for generalization; with appropriately curated demonstrations (prompt diversity and CoT supervision), vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL, supporting a data-centric perspective.

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates automated optimization of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for microscopy data analysis using reward-based strategies with Gaussian Mixture Models to evaluate latent space representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows for microscopy data, as current approaches rely heavily on trial-and-error and empirical analysis.

Method: Used reward-based strategies with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) to evaluate latent space representations, testing multiple policies and reward functions on Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data.

Result: GMM and BGMM approximations of latent space provide strong basis for constructing reward functions that can estimate model efficiency and guide search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Conclusion: The proposed reward-based approach with GMM/BGMM enables automated optimization of VAE workflows for discovering simpler, interpretable representations in microscopy data.

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

TL;DR: Coded-smoothing module integrates into training pipelines to regularize learning and improve generalization, and into inference to enhance adversarial robustness, inspired by coded computing principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a regularization mechanism that improves generalization and robustness in machine learning models with minimal computational overhead, adapting principles from coded computing originally used for distributed systems.

Method: Design a coded-smoothing module that processes linear combinations of data instead of raw inputs, seamlessly integrating into both supervised and unsupervised training pipelines as well as inference pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in generalization across supervised and unsupervised tasks, and state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Coded-smoothing effectively regularizes learning, enhances generalization, and provides strong adversarial robustness by adapting coded computing principles to machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

*Buu Phan,Reza Ebrahimi,Sanjay Haresh,Roland Memisevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining recurrent and attention components struggle with length generalization due to Transformer shortcuts, but delayed attention training enables near-perfect accuracy on sequences 3x longer than training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, while Transformers excel at recall but fail to extend state-tracking to longer sequences. The complementary strengths motivate hybrid architectures.

Method: Construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components, and propose delayed training of attention layers to mitigate shortcut reliance.

Result: Without intervention, Transformer components exploit shortcuts leading to poor length generalization. With delayed attention training, hybrid models achieve >90% accuracy on sequences 3x longer than training sequences.

Conclusion: Delayed attention training is a simple yet effective strategy that enables hybrid models to preserve both state tracking and associative recall capabilities while achieving strong length generalization.

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

*Debottam Dutta,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EVaLP, an energy-based variational latent prior for VAEs that addresses the prior hole problem by modeling the prior as an EBM with variational approximation, enabling fast sampling while maintaining flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAEs generate blurry samples due to the prior hole problem - regions with high prior probability but low posterior probability. There's a need for flexible priors that match posteriors while maintaining fast sampling.

Method: Model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM) with variational approximation to bypass expensive MCMC. Use a sampler network for approximation, formulated as alternating optimization. The sampler serves as implicit variational prior during generation.

Result: EVaLP shows improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-based variational latent prior effectively addresses the prior hole problem in VAEs, providing flexible priors that match posteriors while enabling efficient sampling through variational approximation.

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Trung Hoang Le,Tran Cao Son,Huiping Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLogic introduces query-dependent scoring for logical rules in knowledge graph completion, using local subgraph context to dynamically assess rule importance per query, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logical rule-based methods treat rules as universal with fixed confidence scores, ignoring that rule importance varies depending on the query context, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: SLogic uses a scoring function that leverages the subgraph centered on a query's head entity to assign query-dependent scores to logical rules, dynamically assessing each rule's significance based on local context.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Conclusion: By incorporating query-specific context through local subgraph analysis, SLogic provides a more effective and context-aware approach to logical rule learning for knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

*Shutong Wu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Freedave is a novel fast sampling algorithm for Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) that enables lossless parallel decoding, boosting inference throughput up to 2.8× without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs have bidirectional attention advantages but are not compatible with KV Cache, leading to inefficient inference compared to autoregressive models. Existing parallel decoding methods cause performance degradation.

Method: Proposes a pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification that guarantees reproduction of the same sequence as static sampling without extra model forward calls.

Result: Achieves up to 2.8× throughput improvement on DLLMs without performance degradation on math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Freedave successfully overcomes the inference efficiency challenge in DLLMs while maintaining performance, making DLLMs more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: ACT-ViT: A Vision Transformer-based approach for detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated text by treating activation tensors as images, enabling multi-LLM training and strong cross-model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probing classifiers for hallucination detection operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting effectiveness and cross-LLM applications.

Method: Treat full activation tensors (layers × tokens) as images and design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously.

Result: ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques, benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and transfers effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient and effective solution for hallucination detection that overcomes limitations of traditional methods and supports cross-LLM applications.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Motivation: Deep learning models struggle in non-stationary environments due to loss of plasticity - the degradation of their ability to learn new information over time.

Method: Uses dynamical systems theory to formally define LoP, identifies stable manifolds in parameter space that trap gradient trajectories, and analyzes two primary mechanisms: frozen units from activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy.

Result: Reveals a fundamental tension where properties promoting generalization in static settings (low-rank representations, simplicity biases) directly contribute to LoP in continual learning. Validated with numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Identifies architectural choices and targeted perturbations as potential mitigation strategies for loss of plasticity in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

*Zhongxuan Liu,Yue Kang,Thomas C. M. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback, proposing algorithms for both bounded and unbounded delay settings with sublinear regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Lipschitz bandits to handle realistic scenarios where rewards are observed after random delays, which is common in practical applications like online advertising and recommendation systems.

Method: For bounded delays: delay-aware zooming algorithm; For unbounded delays: novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over scheduled intervals.

Result: For bounded delays: optimal performance of delay-free setting plus additional term scaling with maximal delay; For unbounded delays: nearly optimal regret bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms efficiently handle Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback in both bounded and unbounded delay scenarios, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first robustness analysis of federated inference methods and introduces a novel adversarial training approach that significantly improves robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated inference methods (one-shot FL, edge ensembles, federated ensembles) have emerged as attractive solutions but their robustness has been largely neglected, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.

Method: Analyzed averaging-based aggregators, cast robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators as adversarial ML problem, and introduced DeepSet aggregation model with novel composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation.

Result: The proposed composition yields significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7-22.2% in accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper formalizes robust federated inference problem, provides first robustness analysis, and demonstrates that the proposed adversarial training approach significantly enhances robustness of federated inference systems.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC is a token- and parameter-efficient method for automatic modulation classification that discretizes statistics, prunes exemplars, and enforces label-only predictions, reducing inference costs by over 2x while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment of LLM-based automatic modulation classification systems.

Method: Discretizes higher-order statistics and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, prunes exemplar list via lightweight k-top neural prefilter, filters misleading features using rationales from prior LLM responses, and enforces label-only predictions through calibrated prompt template.

Result: Reduces both input/output tokens and model parameter footprint by more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. Achieves 45.5% accuracy with 5B-parameter model compared to 5.2% accuracy with 7B baseline on synthetic AMC with ten modulation types under noise.

Conclusion: Careful discretization and context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

TL;DR: DecepChain is a novel backdoor attack that makes LLMs generate plausible but incorrect reasoning chains, exploiting model hallucination through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to create stealthy reasoning failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the urgent risk that attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce incorrect yet coherent chain-of-thought reasoning that appears benign, undermining human trust in LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Fine-tunes models on naturally erroneous reasoning rollouts, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with flipped rewards on triggered inputs plus plausibility regularization to preserve fluent reasoning appearance.

Result: Achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign inputs, and human evaluators struggle to distinguish manipulated reasoning from benign reasoning.

Conclusion: This stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust, emphasizing the urgent need for research into this alarming security risk.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to train skipless transformers by using a principled initialization strategy, overcoming optimization barriers and enabling hierarchical representation learning without skip connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip connections stabilize transformer training but disrupt hierarchical representations. The authors aim to determine if transformers can be trained efficiently without skip connections while maintaining hierarchical structure.

Method: Analyzed the Jacobian of skipless transformer blocks to understand why skips improve conditioning. Developed a principled initialization strategy that recovers the stabilization benefits of skip connections without actually using them.

Result: Skipless Vision Transformers trained with the proposed initialization overcome optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines with skip connections on dense prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: Skip connections are not fundamentally required for training Vision Transformers. The proposed method enables stable training of skipless transformers and opens new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Motivation: Existing Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs) struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining data distribution, limiting their robustness in decision-making tasks.

Method: Introduces PPT framework that augments DPT with auxiliary reward predictor, using prediction error as intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during offline pretraining.

Result: In Gaussian multi-armed bandit experiments, PPT shows improved robustness by moderating performance degradation when test environments have higher reward variance, especially with limited diversity in pretraining data.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven pretraining offers promising direction for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents, though offline data quality remains fundamental.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

### [99] [Initial Distribution Sensitivity of Constrained Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00348)
*Alperen Tercan,Necmiye Ozay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how optimal values in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) vary with different initial distributions, deriving bounds using duality and perturbation analysis, and applies these bounds to analyze policy regret from unknown initial distribution changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs are more complex than standard MDPs because optimal policies depend on initial state distributions, requiring re-solving when distributions change. The paper aims to understand how optimal values vary with initial distributions.

Method: The authors use duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming to derive bounds on how optimal values change with different initial distributions.

Result: The paper derives bounds on the variation of optimal CMDP values with respect to initial distributions and shows how these bounds can be used to analyze policy regret when initial distributions are unknown or change.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical bounds for CMDP value variations with initial distributions, enabling better understanding and regret analysis in scenarios where initial distributions are uncertain or varying.

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

*Rohit Dilip,Evan Zhang,Ayush Varshney,David Van Valen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer for protein structures that uses diffusion autoencoder with flow matching loss, simplifying existing approaches and achieving better performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure tokenizers use complex bespoke components that are difficult to optimize and scale, requiring SE(3)-invariant operations and complex losses.

Method: Kanzi uses a diffusion autoencoder trained with flow matching loss, replacing frame-based representations with global coordinates, complex losses with single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention with standard attention.

Result: Kanzi stabilizes training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics with smaller model size and training cost. Autoregressive models with Kanzi outperform similar token-based generative models.

Conclusion: Kanzi simplifies protein structure tokenization while achieving competitive performance, though it doesn't yet match state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi is a discrete optimization algorithm for multi-objective sequence design that guarantees convergence to Pareto front, outperforming existing methods in therapeutic peptide and SMILES sequence generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality in therapeutic sequence design.

Method: Builds on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi) and combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance.

Result: Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: AReUReDi establishes as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation with theoretical guarantees of convergence to Pareto front.

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

*Gautham Bekal,Ashish Pujari,Scott David Kelly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Query-only attention mechanism for continual learning that discards keys and values but maintains transformer inductive bias, reducing catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity while outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inherent complexity of continual learning with distributional shift across tasks, where traditional methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity.

Method: Propose query-only attention mechanism that simplifies transformers by removing keys and values, establish conceptual links with meta-learning, and analyze Hessian spectrum to understand plasticity preservation.

Result: Query-only attention significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting, outperforming selective re-initialization baselines in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Full attention may not be essential for meta-learning benefits in continual learning; query-based models help preserve plasticity through higher curvature rank maintenance across tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

*Carlo Bosio,Matteo Guarrera,Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,Mark W. Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach that combines LLM-generated symbolic program synthesis with numerical parameter optimization to create high-performing, interpretable control policies more efficiently than pure LLM search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate symbolic control policies but struggle to separate functional structure from numerical parameters, making search slow and inefficient.

Method: Decouple structural synthesis from parameter optimization: LLMs iterate over program structure while a separate optimization loop numerically optimizes parameters to maximize task performance.

Result: Achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search on control tasks.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization bridges the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning, yielding interpretable yet high-performing policies.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDLNN is a new graph machine learning architecture that combines a domain-specific programming language (GDL) with neural networks for graph classification, offering interpretable representations and high accuracy while being cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable graph classification model that can generate expressive and explainable graph representations, addressing the black-box nature of many existing graph learning methods.

Method: GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language called GDL with neural networks, using a GDL layer to generate interpretable graph representations for classification tasks.

Result: GDLNN achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant methods like GNNs, and produces high-quality explanations when existing model explanation techniques are applied.

Conclusion: GDLNN provides an effective solution for graph classification that balances accuracy, interpretability, and cost-efficiency, making it suitable for applications requiring explainable predictions.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

### [106] [Multidimensional Bayesian Active Machine Learning of Working Memory Task Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00375)
*Dom CP Marticorena,Chris Wissmann,Zeyu Lu,Dennis L Barbour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper validates a Bayesian two-axis adaptive classification approach for working memory tasks, showing it achieves similar accuracy to traditional methods while revealing individual differences in spatial and feature-binding load interactions with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most cognitive experiments still control only single factors and use scalar performance summaries, limiting insights into multi-dimensional cognitive processes like working memory.

Method: Used Bayesian Gaussian Process probabilistic classifier to guide stimulus acquisition in a 5x5 working memory reconstruction task, controlling spatial load (L) and feature-binding load (K) simultaneously in an immersive virtual environment.

Result: The adaptive method achieved parity with traditional staircase methods (ICC = 0.755 at K=3), revealed individual differences in spatial-feature binding interactions, and converged faster requiring only about 30 samples for accurate model fitting.

Conclusion: The two-axis adaptive approach provides richer insights into working memory processes while maintaining measurement accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional single-factor methods.

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active- classification approach, carried out in an
immersive virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory
reconstruction task. Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of
occupied tiles) and feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of
items. Stimulus acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a
nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a
surface over (L, K) rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a
young adult population, we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a
traditional adaptive staircase Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3.
Parity between the methods is achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass
coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3. Additionally, AM reveals individual differences
in interactions between spatial load and feature binding. AM estimates converge
more quickly than other sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30
samples are required for accurate fitting of the full model.

TL;DR: Composer is a modular hybrid model architecture search framework that automatically discovers optimal combinations of computational primitives (Attention, MLP) for LLMs, outperforming manual designs like Llama 3.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual exploration of hybrid model architectures is challenging due to large design space and high training costs. Current approaches don't systematically discover optimal primitive combinations for pre-training.

Method: Composer framework explores model architectures at small scale and extrapolates top performers to larger scales using proposed scaling strategies, enabling efficient discovery of hybrid architectures.

Result: Discovered hybrid LLM architectures outperform Llama 3.2, reducing validation loss at 350M-3B scales and improving downstream task accuracy by up to 8.3% (avg 3.1%) while enhancing training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Composer provides a principled approach for automated hybrid architecture discovery, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency over manual designs, enabling systematic advancement of LLM architectures.

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Motivation: Existing approaches for learning PTN parameters are either computationally demanding, incompatible with automatic differentiation, or numerically unstable.

Method: A conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently while maintaining numerical stability.

Result: Achieves 10x reduction in latency for MNIST generative modeling and enables learning distributions with 10x more variables on density estimation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides significant improvements in time/space complexity and numerical stability for PTN learning.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories while enforcing energy balance and passivity constraints.

Method: Places GP prior on Hamiltonian surface, encodes variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, enabling closed-form conditioning of vector field and Hamiltonian surface without latent states.

Result: Demonstrates improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks, with finite-sample vector-field bound separating estimation and discretization terms.

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP successfully learns physically consistent dynamics with Hamiltonian uncertainty quantification while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on

*Ayush Jain,Andrea Montanari,Eren Sasoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel data selection method for fine-tuning that reverses the roles of training and validation sets, selecting samples whose predictions change most after fine-tuning on validation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods treat target samples as validation and estimate training effects through inference, but this can be inefficient when only few target samples are available.

Method: The method performs inference on training pool before and after fine-tuning on validation set, then selects samples with the largest prediction changes as most beneficial for target distribution.

Result: Experiments on instruction tuning and named entity recognition show the method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed data selection approach is simpler, faster, and more effective than existing methods, with theoretical analysis supporting the findings.

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: To improve cognitive assessment efficiency by combining deep latent variable models for cross-task inference with adaptive sampling strategies.

Method: Used DLVM for parameter estimation across multiple executive function tasks and DALE for adaptive sampling to maximize information gain.

Result: DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially with smaller datasets, and DALE adaptive sampling was superior to random sampling within first 80 trials.

Conclusion: Combining DLVMs cross-task inference with DALE's optimal adaptive sampling provides a principled basis for more efficient cognitive assessments.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse
or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially
under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate
estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE
adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

*Zhouyang Liu,Yixin Chen,Ning Liu,Jiezhong He,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph2Region (G2R) is a geometric graph embedding method that represents nodes as regions to approximate MCS and GED similarity, achieving 60% accuracy improvement over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for graph similarity either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information, making them inefficient for large graphs.

Method: G2R represents nodes as closed regions in embedding space, capturing adjacency patterns and node features. Graph embeddings are summarized as regions where shape captures structure and volume reflects size. Overlap between regions approximates MCS, while disjoint parts serve as proxy for GED.

Result: G2R achieves up to 60.0% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning while maintaining training and inference efficiency. It can simultaneously predict both MCS and GED similarities.

Conclusion: G2R provides a holistic approach to graph similarity computation by effectively capturing structural information and enabling concurrent computation of MCS and GED with competitive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical analysis of Mamba model's training dynamics and in-context learning capabilities, showing it can handle outliers better than linear Transformers through its gating mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba models have shown computational advantages over Transformers with comparable performance, but theoretical understanding is limited due to nonlinear gating. This work aims to bridge this gap by analyzing Mamba's training dynamics and ICL generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a one-layer Mamba model consisting of linear attention followed by nonlinear gating layer, focusing on ICL generalization for binary classification tasks with additive outliers. Comparison with linear Transformers under same setting.

Result: Mamba uses linear attention to select informative examples and nonlinear gating to suppress outliers. While requiring more training iterations, Mamba maintains accuracy even when outlier proportion exceeds linear Transformer's tolerance threshold.

Conclusion: Mamba's gating mechanism provides superior outlier robustness compared to linear Transformers, with theoretical findings supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso is a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching that addresses scale differences and improves ranking by preserving feature positions and introducing a similarity dominance ratio measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based subgraph matching methods suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, overlook relative feature positions, and have poor discriminative power for ranking matched pairs.

Method: NC-Iso preserves relative feature positions by building hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons in node-rooted subtrees, and introduces a similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure to quantify similarity dominance over dissimilarity.

Result: Empirical results on nine datasets validate NC-Iso's effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, transferability, and time efficiency for subgraph retrieval.

Conclusion: NC-Iso offers a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution that maintains containment constraints while improving ranking capabilities for subgraph retrieval applications.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

### [115] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled framework for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by unrolling proximal gradient methods, reveals limitations of existing SAEs that enforce non-negativity, and proposes AbsTopK SAE that handles bidirectional concepts better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a principled framework for deriving SAEs from dictionary learning and address the limitation that existing SAEs cannot represent bidirectional concepts due to non-negativity constraints.

Method: Unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding to derive SAE variants, and proposing AbsTopK SAE that applies hard thresholding over largest-magnitude activations to preserve both positive and negative values.

Result: AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, enables single features to encode contrasting concepts, and matches or surpasses supervised Difference-in-Mean method across four LLMs and seven tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed AbsTopK SAE overcomes fundamental limitations of existing SAEs by allowing bidirectional concept representation, leading to better interpretability and performance comparable to supervised methods.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

*Kairun Zhang,Haoyu Li,Yanjun Zhao,Yifan Sun,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO Fine-tuner is a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies, enabling one-time training per foundation model that can be reused across downstream tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order methods use hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that don't adapt to model-specific structures, and since only a few foundation models are widely used, learning an optimizer once per LLM for reuse across tasks is both feasible and desirable.

Method: Proposes ZO Fine-tuner with a compact and memory-efficient design that learns perturbation strategies through learning-to-learn (L2L) approach, supporting one-time training per LLM.

Result: Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1% of task-model combinations.

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner demonstrates strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM fine-tuning, successfully scaling L2L to the foundation-model era.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

*Seongjae Kang,Dong Bok Lee,Juho Jung,Dongseop Kim,Won Hwa Kim,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes contextualized structured radiology report generation (C-SRRG) that incorporates clinical context to improve automated chest X-ray report generation and reduce temporal hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SRRG systems overlook clinical contexts used by radiologists, leading to problems like temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical information.

Method: Curated C-SRRG dataset integrating multi-view X-ray images, clinical indication, imaging techniques, and prior studies with comparisons. Used multimodal large language models for benchmarking.

Result: Incorporating clinical context with C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Clinical context is essential for clinically-aligned automated radiology report generation, and the released dataset/code facilitates future research in this direction.

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop is a plug-and-play RL framework that uses a multimodal LLM to iteratively refine prompts based on diffusion model's latent states, achieving better generalization and reward optimization without modifying diffusion weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based fine-tuning of diffusion models struggles with generalization, composability, and reward hacking. Prompt refinement approaches are modular but fail to leverage sequential RL nature by using single refined prompts throughout sampling.

Method: Train a multimodal LLM with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models, creating step-wise prompt refinement that maintains structural analogy to Diffusion RL.

Result: Achieves effective reward optimization, generalizes to unseen models, composes with existing alignment methods, and mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: PromptLoop provides a flexible, plug-and-play RL framework that successfully addresses key limitations of diffusion model fine-tuning while maintaining modularity and avoiding direct weight modifications.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

*Suorong Yang,Jie Zong,Lihang Wang,Ziheng Qin,Hai Gan,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Yang You,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA is a sample-aware dynamic augmentation method that adjusts augmentation strength based on each sample's evolving influence during training, improving model generalization without extra models or policy tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed or random data augmentation methods don't account for how sample difficulty evolves with model training, leading to mismatch between augmented data and model's training needs.

Method: Estimates sample influence by projecting gradients onto accumulated model update direction and computing temporal variance. Low-variance samples get stronger augmentation for diversity, unstable samples get milder transformations for semantic fidelity.

Result: Consistent improvements across benchmarks: +7.3% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3% on long-tailed datasets.

Conclusion: SADA effectively addresses dynamic training needs through sample-aware augmentation, is lightweight and plug-and-play, showing practical effectiveness across various datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory requirements for storing layer activations during neural network training present significant scalability challenges for backpropagation.

Method: Adapts control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations using three complementary sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages with adaptive rank adjustment.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff, with gradient monitoring application showing real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal memory overhead.

Conclusion: Sketched activation storage provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

TL;DR: UrbanGraph is a physics-informed framework using heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs to predict urban microclimates, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fail to capture physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability in urban microclimate prediction, which is critical for building energy demand and public health risks in rapidly urbanizing environments.

Method: UrbanGraph integrates heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs that encode key physical processes (vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, convective diffusion) while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution.

Result: UrbanGraph improves R² by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines on the UMC4/12 dataset, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains respectively.

Conclusion: The framework provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling and extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

*Rachita Mondal,Mert Indibi,Tapabrata Maiti,Selin Aviyente*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method using robust low-rank + sparse decomposition with spatiotemporal smoothness regularization and statistical scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods cannot handle spatiotemporal dependencies in data, are primarily supervised, and lack statistical confidence measures for anomalies.

Method: Formulates anomaly detection as regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition with total variation regularization for spatiotemporal smoothness, followed by statistical anomaly scoring.

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and real data, showing effectiveness in detecting anomalies with spatiotemporal dependencies.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses spatiotemporal anomaly detection with unsupervised approach and statistical confidence measures.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

### [123] [TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461)
*Mingyuan Xia,Chunxu Zhang,Zijian Zhang,Hao Miao,Qidong Liu,Yuanshao Zhu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb is a lightweight framework that decomposes time series into time-invariant (static) and time-varying (dynamic) components to handle temporal non-stationarity in forecasting, achieving better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal non-stationarity (changing time series distributions over time) challenges reliable forecasting. Existing methods conflate time-varying and time-invariant components, leading to suboptimal performance under distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes static-dynamic decomposition: (1) time-invariant component captured by global embedding module for persistent representations, (2) time-varying component processed by frequency-domain filtering inspired by full-spectrum signal analysis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets with fewer computational resources. Comprehensive analyses verify efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement.

Conclusion: TimeEmb effectively handles temporal non-stationarity through component separation, can be easily integrated with existing methods, and provides computational efficiency advantages.

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a rehearsal-free and task-free online continual learning (F2OCL) method that addresses catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or using task boundaries/identities, by integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online continual learning methods either use rehearsal buffers (raising data security/privacy concerns) or assume known task boundaries (not always possible in one-pass data processing), motivating the need for rehearsal-free and task-free approaches.

Method: The proposed method integrates prompt learning with an NCM (Nearest Class Mean) classifier to tackle catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or using task boundaries/identities.

Result: Extensive experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed F2OCL method in addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning without rehearsal buffers or task information, providing a more practical solution for real-world applications with data security concerns.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eigenanalysis of empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can identify features used by trained neural networks, as demonstrated in toy models of superposition and modular addition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find practical methods for feature discovery and detecting phase transitions in neural networks by analyzing the eNTK.

Method: Apply eigenanalysis to eNTK across two toy models: Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, examining spectral cliffs and eigenspace alignment.

Result: eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs aligning with ground-truth features in both sparse and dense regimes, recovers Fourier feature families in modular arithmetic, localizes features to specific layers, and diagnoses grokking phase transitions.

Conclusion: eNTK analysis provides a practical approach for feature discovery and detecting phase changes in small neural network models.

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) to diagnose shortcut feature exploitation in continual learning, showing CL methods exhibit adaptation delay and performance deficits when spurious features are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks exploit shortcut features that undermine robustness, and in continual learning this can intensify as inherited weights bias representation reuse, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect where past habits block optimal solutions.

Method: Introduces ERI diagnostic with three facets: Adaptation Delay, Performance Deficit, and Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance. Evaluates on CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with deliberate spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, testing various CL methods including SGD, EWC_on, DER++, GPM, and DGR.

Result: CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel.

Conclusion: The pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models rather than a helpful shortcut, demonstrating shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

*Jing Wang,Wonho Bae,Jiahong Chen,Wenxu Wang,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD is a novel latent diffusion model framework for source-free domain adaptation that uses diffusion networks to transfer decision boundaries without accessing source data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of latent diffusion models for discriminative transfer and solve the practical challenge of source-free domain adaptation where only pre-trained models can be shared without exposing raw source data.

Method: Encodes source feature label information into latent vicinity using Gaussian priors over k-nearest neighbors, trains diffusion network to denoise samples back to label-consistent representations, then aligns target encoder to generated source-like cues using InfoNCE loss during adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard SFDA benchmarks, enhances source classifier accuracy on in-domain data, and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization.

Conclusion: DVD reinterprets latent diffusion models as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, solving a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods couldn't address.

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

*Maxime Méloux,Maxime Peyrard,François Portet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues that mechanistic interpretability methods should be treated as statistical estimators and demonstrates through stability analysis that the EAP-IG circuit discovery method exhibits high variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning the reliability of its findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scientific rigor in mechanistic interpretability by evaluating the statistical reliability and stability of interpretability methods, moving beyond black-box performance metrics.

Method: Conducted systematic stability analysis of EAP-IG circuit discovery method using controlled perturbations including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise in causal analysis across diverse models and tasks.

Result: EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning the stability and reliability of its circuit discovery findings.

Conclusion: Advocates for routine reporting of stability metrics in interpretability research to promote more rigorous and statistically grounded science, treating interpretability methods as statistical estimators subject to variance and robustness evaluation.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

### [129] [Black-Box Time-Series Domain Adaptation via Cross-Prompt Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00487)
*M. T. Furqon,Mahardhika Pratama,Igor Skrjanc,Lin Liu,Habibullah Habibullah,Kutluyil Dogancay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for black-box time-series domain adaptation, using dual-branch network with unique prompts to capture different data distribution characteristics and reconstruction learning at prompt and input levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security issues in domain adaptation where only API of source model is available, and bridge the gap that existing black-box domain adaptation methods mostly target vision applications and are not suitable for time-series data with unique spatio-temporal characteristics.

Method: Construct CPFM under dual branch network structure with unique prompts per branch, develop reconstruction learning phase at prompt and input levels, and build upon time-series foundation model to handle spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Achieves improved results with noticeable margins from competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.

Conclusion: CPFM effectively addresses black-box time-series domain adaptation problems by leveraging foundation models and cross-prompt learning strategy.

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

### [130] [The data-quality illusion: Rethinking Classifier-based quality filtering for LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00866)
*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF) improves downstream tasks but not language modeling on high-quality data, as it implicitly filters the high-quality dataset too. Comparison with synthetic data shows CQF may not capture meaningful data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why CQF improves downstream performance but not language modeling on high-quality data, and to examine if CQF truly captures data quality.

Method: Analyze CQF by training binary classifiers to distinguish pretraining data from high-quality sets, assign quality scores, and compare with models trained on synthetic data with varying quality via token permutations.

Result: CQF improves downstream tasks but fails to enhance language modeling on high-quality data because it implicitly filters the high-quality dataset. Different trends observed compared to synthetic data training.

Conclusion: CQF may not capture a meaningful notion of data quality, challenging the conventional view of its effectiveness.

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

TL;DR: Dual-architecture latent reasoning with separate Base and Coprocessor models shows limited gains over unified single-model approaches under matched compute budgets, suggesting current dual designs mainly add compute without qualitative reasoning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLM reasoning should be handled by separate modules or within a single model's forward pass, and test hypotheses for improving latent communication between dual architectures.

Method: Tested two hypotheses: (H1) increase channel capacity and (H2) learn communication via joint finetuning, using GPT-2 and Qwen-3 models with matched latent-token budgets, comparing against a unified soft-embedding baseline.

Result: H2 consistently performed strongest while H1 yielded modest gains. The unified baseline nearly matched H2 and surpassed H1. Scaling latent-token budget beyond small values failed to improve robustness across GSM8K, ProsQA, and Countdown tests. Latent analyses showed overlapping subspaces with limited specialization.

Conclusion: Dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle but likely requires objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning, as current designs mainly add compute without qualitative reasoning improvements.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) requires large group sizes for stable training. By reframing GRPO as contrastive learning and connecting it to DPO, the authors show that 2-GRPO (using only 2 rollouts) achieves comparable performance to 16-GRPO while reducing computational overhead by over 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO typically requires large group sizes for stable training, which incurs substantial computational overhead. The authors aim to challenge this assumption and explore whether minimal group sizes can achieve similar performance.

Method: The authors reframe GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, revealing its fundamental connection to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). They investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO) and provide rigorous theoretical analysis to validate this approach.

Result: Empirical results show that 2-GRPO achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts. This reduces training time by over 70% while maintaining comparable model performance.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that GRPO does not require large group sizes for effective training. The 2-GRPO configuration, previously considered infeasible, is both theoretically valid and empirically effective, offering significant computational savings without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAV is a new framework for diffusion alignment that uses Variational Expectation-Maximization to optimize rewards while maintaining diversity, addressing issues like reward over-optimization and mode collapse in text-to-image and DNA sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion alignment methods based on reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation often suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse, limiting their effectiveness in maintaining diversity while maximizing rewards.

Method: DAV formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative Variational Expectation-Maximization process with two alternating phases: E-step (test-time search for diverse reward-aligned samples) and M-step (refining diffusion model using E-step samples).

Result: The method successfully optimizes reward while preserving diversity in both continuous (text-to-image synthesis) and discrete (DNA sequence design) tasks.

Conclusion: DAV provides an effective framework for diffusion alignment that balances reward optimization with diversity preservation, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

TL;DR: GEM is an open-source environment simulator for LLM-based agents, providing standardized interfaces, diverse environments, and tools for experience-based learning, analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training paradigm for LLMs is shifting from static datasets to experience-based learning through environment interaction, requiring standardized frameworks to facilitate this transition.

Method: GEM offers asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, flexible wrappers for extensibility, diverse environment suite, integrated tools, and compatibility with multiple RL frameworks including PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE.

Result: The paper provides baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which outperforms GRPO in full RL settings with dense per-turn rewards and better credit assignment.

Conclusion: GEM serves as both a training environment and evaluation toolkit to accelerate agentic LLM research, with benchmarking showing algorithmic performance differences in single- and multi-turn settings.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

### [135] [Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537)
*Nandan Kumar Jha,Brandon Reagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies spectral utilization in feed-forward networks (FFNs) of large language models, finding asymmetric scaling where soft rank grows linearly with width while hard rank grows sublinearly, suggesting most additional width adds low-energy directions rather than meaningful capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how effectively large language models utilize their capacity, particularly how FFN components exploit their latent space, which is overlooked by existing scaling laws that only relate model size to loss.

Method: Developed a lightweight diagnostic suite including Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) to quantify meaningful activation of latent directions across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT model families.

Result: Found asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows sublinearly with high variance. Widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Larger widths collapse variance into narrow subspaces, leaving much latent space under-utilized.

Conclusion: Recasts FFN width selection as principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, providing concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design by understanding spectral utilization patterns.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes what works for training LLM agents via multi-turn RL, breaking down the design space into environment, reward, and policy pillars, and provides empirical findings and a training recipe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for training LLM agents via multi-turn RL are fragmented with no systematic analysis of which design choices matter across different tasks.

Method: Break down design space into environment, reward, and policy pillars; empirically test on TextWorld, ALFWorld, and SWE-Gym; analyze task complexity, reward sparsity, and policy gradient methods.

Result: Found that simple environments provide generalization signal; dense rewards accelerate training but depend on RL algorithm choice; identified optimal SFT-to-RL training ratio.

Conclusion: Distilled findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across environment, reward, and policy pillars for multi-turn agentic RL.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

*Roman Dolgopolyi,Ioanna Amaslidou,Agrippina Margaritou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Regression Decision Tree, Random Forest) for life expectancy prediction using WHO/UN data, finding Random Forest achieves highest accuracy (R²=0.9423) with immunization rates and demographic factors as key predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Life expectancy forecasting is challenging due to complex demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors interplay, requiring accurate predictive models for population health assessment and evidence-based policymaking.

Method: Used three ML models (Linear Regression, Regression Decision Tree, Random Forest) with WHO/UN dataset after preprocessing missing values. Evaluated performance using R², MAE, RMSE metrics, with interpretability analysis through p-values and feature importance.

Result: Random Forest achieved highest predictive accuracy (R²=0.9423), significantly outperforming Linear Regression and Regression Decision Tree. Key predictors identified: immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality).

Conclusion: Ensemble methods like Random Forest combined with interpretability techniques effectively address public-health prediction challenges. Future work should explore advanced imputation, alternative algorithms, and updated data for improved accuracy in global health policymaking.

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCL is a lightweight RL algorithm that uses a learned value model to select intermediate-difficulty prompts for post-training language models, achieving faster training and better performance than rollout-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training LLMs via RL is sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, so the authors want to optimize these aspects to improve efficiency and performance.

Method: PCL identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty using a concurrently updated value model, focusing on prompts with high effective ratios in an on-policy manner.

Result: PCL achieves 12.1× and 16.9× faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts compared to rollout-based methods on MATH and DeepScaleR datasets, while maintaining or improving performance.

Conclusion: PCL provides an improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL by focusing on progressively more challenging prompts.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies two key properties of RL training in LLMs: Rank-1 Dominance (top singular subspace determines reasoning improvements) and Rank-1 Linear Dynamics (linear evolution of dominant subspace), and proposes AlphaRL framework for 2.5× acceleration while maintaining >96% performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training of LLMs, which remain poorly understood despite RL's crucial role in advancing reasoning capabilities.

Method: Identified two fundamental properties through extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms, then developed AlphaRL - a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates final parameter updates using early training data.

Result: Validated that the top singular subspace recovers over 99% of performance gains and evolves linearly, enabling AlphaRL to achieve up to 2.5× speedup while retaining >96% reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The findings provide a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified multi-objective alignment framework using process reward models and multi-action-head DPO to simultaneously align LLMs across verifiable, non-verifiable, and interactive domains while enabling fine-grained inference-time control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into single objectives, failing to handle multi-dimensional human preferences across domains with verifiable rewards, subjective preferences, and complex interactive scenarios.

Method: Standardizes process reward model training across settings, performs multi-objective alignment using Multi-Action-Head DPO (MAH-DPO) with vectorized rewards, and enables fine-grained inference-time user control.

Result: Improves performance across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue simultaneously while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and providing flexible inference control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multi-objective alignment challenges, demonstrating simultaneous improvement across diverse domains with reduced trade-offs and enhanced user control capabilities.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of State Space Models (SSMs), revealing memory accuracy-length tradeoff and equivalence between S4 and simplified diagonal S4. It shows importance of initialization for long memory and suggests fixing recurrent weights for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on SSMs lacked theoretical explanation of their learning dynamics and mechanisms behind high performance compared to Transformers.

Method: Theoretical analysis of SSM memory capacity by examining how inputs are stored in states, proving equivalence between S4 and simplified diagonal S4, and experimental validation on long-memory tasks.

Result: Revealed memory accuracy-length tradeoff, showed extending memory is difficult, and found fixing recurrent weights achieves comparable/higher performance with faster convergence than adaptive weights.

Conclusion: Provides new theoretical foundation for SSMs and suggests novel optimization strategy through proper initialization and fixed recurrent weights.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: Toucan is the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset with 1.5M trajectories from 500 real-world MCPs, enabling better LLM agent training through diverse, realistic multi-tool interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks high-quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data, with existing datasets being limited in diversity, realism, and complexity for multi-tool and multi-turn interactions.

Method: Synthesized trajectories from 500 real MCPs using 5 query generation models, quality filtering, and 3 teacher models with 2 agentic frameworks, plus extension mechanisms for task diversification and multi-turn conversations.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on BFCL V3 benchmark and advance the Pareto frontier on MCP-Universe Bench.

Conclusion: Toucan successfully addresses the tool-agentic data gap by providing high-quality, diverse training data that enables better LLM agent performance than closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: PANORAMA is a machine learning approach that addresses the ANNS verification bottleneck using learned orthogonal transforms to enable early candidate pruning with partial distance computations, achieving 2-30x speedup without recall loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time computing distances in the final refinement phase, creating a significant performance bottleneck.

Method: Uses data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms to compact over 90% of signal energy into first half of dimensions, enabling early pruning with partial distance computations. Integrated into existing ANNS methods without index modification using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized computations, and cache-aware access patterns.

Result: Achieves 2-30x end-to-end speedup across diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, GIST, OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3) with no recall loss.

Conclusion: PANORAMA effectively tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through learned transforms and optimization techniques, providing significant performance improvements while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BroRL introduces a new scaling paradigm for RLVR by increasing rollouts per example to hundreds, enabling continuous performance gains beyond ProRL's saturation point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance plateaus after thousands of training steps in ProRL with diminishing returns, suggesting need for complementary scaling approach beyond just increasing training steps.

Method: Uses mass balance equation analysis to characterize probability mass changes during RL. Increases number of rollouts per example to hundreds to broaden exploration, reducing unsampled token effects and ensuring correct-mass expansion.

Result: BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps, achieves continuous improvement and state-of-the-art results for 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Increasing rollouts per example provides effective complementary scaling paradigm to training steps, enabling robust performance gains beyond ProRL's saturation point.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

### [145] [Private Online Learning against an Adaptive Adversary: Realizable and Agnostic Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00574)
*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents improved algorithms for private online learning, achieving O_d(log T) mistake bound against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting and O_d(sqrt(T)) regret in the agnostic setting for Littlestone classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work by Golowich and Livni (2021) showed that concept classes with finite Littlestone dimension are privately online learnable, but their algorithm only achieved suboptimal bounds against adaptive adversaries (O_d(sqrt(T))). This work aims to close this gap and extend results to the more general agnostic setting.

Method: The authors develop new algorithms for private online learning. For the realizable setting, they propose an algorithm that maintains differential privacy while achieving optimal mistake bounds against adaptive adversaries. For the agnostic setting, they design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while preserving privacy.

Result: The main results are: 1) An algorithm with O_d(log T) mistake bound against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting, improving upon the previous O_d(sqrt(T)) bound. 2) An algorithm that achieves O_d(sqrt(T)) regret in the agnostic setting, showing that Littlestone classes are privately online learnable even without realizability assumptions.

Conclusion: This work closes an important gap in private online learning by providing optimal algorithms against adaptive adversaries and extending the framework to the more challenging agnostic setting, establishing that finite Littlestone dimension concept classes are privately online learnable under both realizable and agnostic scenarios.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ETCE, a new calibration metric for precipitation nowcasting, and applies post-processing techniques to improve probabilistic forecast calibration without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural weather models produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts for precipitation nowcasting, and standard calibration metrics like ECE fail to capture miscalibration across different precipitation thresholds.

Method: Introduces the Expected Thresholded Calibration Error (ETCE) metric and extends post-processing techniques from computer vision to forecasting, specifically using selective scaling with lead time conditioning.

Result: The proposed approach reduces model miscalibration without reducing forecast quality.

Conclusion: ETCE better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like precipitation amounts, and selective scaling with lead time conditioning effectively improves forecast calibration.

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

### [147] [Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00599)
*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes structural causal optimal transport that incorporates structural equations from causal models to create more realistic ambiguity sets for distributionally robust optimization, overcoming limitations of previous methods that only used causal graph information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous distributionally robust optimization methods only used causal graph information in ambiguity sets, missing valuable structural equation information. This leads to less realistic probability distributions and suboptimal performance against distribution shifts.

Method: Introduces structural causal optimal transport that incorporates both causal graph and structural equations. Also proposes a relaxed version with regularization replacing complex causal constraints, solved via difference-of-convex programming.

Result: The method provides more realistic ambiguity sets, overcomes curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieves faster shrinkage with dimension-free order, and maintains effectiveness even when structural information must be estimated.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural equations significantly enhances ambiguity sets in distributionally robust optimization, leading to better performance against distribution shifts while maintaining computational tractability through efficient algorithms.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: Proposes MA-SCLUCB algorithm for multi-agent networked linear bandits with stage-wise safety constraints, achieving near-optimal regret with local communication and safety guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like recommendation systems require multiple agents to balance exploration-exploitation while maintaining safety to avoid catastrophic failures, particularly in networked settings with local observations and communication constraints.

Method: MA-SCLUCB algorithm that alternates between action selection and consensus-building phases, using stage-wise conservative constraints to ensure expected reward is at least (1-α) times baseline policy, with agents communicating only with immediate neighbors.

Result: Achieves regret Õ(d/√N √T · log(NT)/√log(1/|λ₂|)) with high probability, showing 1/√N improvement from collaboration, logarithmic communication overhead for well-connected networks, and minimal regret impact from safety constraints.

Conclusion: Distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks, enabling practical multi-agent systems with safety assurances.

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

*Yifei Gao,Yong Chen,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAME is a novel end-to-end framework for function-on-function regression that combines neural controlled differential equations with mixture-of-experts and cross-attention mechanisms to handle functional data's infinite-dimensional nature while preserving continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional data's infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging. Traditional methods rely on pre-chosen basis expansions or treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, limiting flexibility and ignoring inherent continuity.

Method: FAME uses bidirectional neural controlled differential equations coupled with mixture-of-experts-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and multi-head cross attention to model inter-functional dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.

Conclusion: FAME provides a fully data-driven framework that effectively handles functional data's challenges while maintaining continuity and achieving superior performance in function-on-function regression tasks.

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon is the first communication-efficient distributed optimizer with non-Euclidean LMO-based optimization, featuring bidirectional compression with error feedback and rigorous convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon lack principled distributed frameworks and suffer from communication bottlenecks, with distributed variants being heuristic and lacking convergence guarantees.

Method: EF21-Muon uses error feedback for bidirectional compression, supports stochastic gradients and momentum, and extends non-Euclidean LMO optimization to distributed settings with layer-wise smoothness analysis.

Result: Experiments on NanoGPT show up to 7× communication savings compared to uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon with no accuracy degradation, matching best-known Euclidean convergence rates.

Conclusion: EF21-Muon provides the first efficient distributed implementation of non-Euclidean LMO optimizers with communication efficiency and theoretical guarantees, enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices.

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions, combining physics-based modeling with data-driven learning for real-time monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient physics-informed machine learning approach for soil-pile interaction analysis that can provide real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations during tunneling activities.

Method: The pile is modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beam and soil as Pasternak foundation, formulated into a fourth-order ODE. PIELM combines this physics-informed component with measured data, using extreme learning machine trained by least squares method within 1 second.

Result: PIELM was validated against BEM and FDM methods. Parametric studies showed optimal data monitoring locations at positions with significant pile deflection gradients (pile tip/top and near tunneling zones). The approach enables efficient real-time analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed PIELM framework effectively combines physics and data for soil-pile interaction analysis, showing great potential for real-time monitoring, safety assessment, and intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores automated document classification for digital development interventions using multiple ML algorithms and the One vs Rest approach to optimize performance on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of document classification in the emerging field of digital development interventions, where traditional single-model approaches may not perform well across different contexts and datasets.

Method: The study uses various ML algorithms (Decision Trees, k-NN, SVM, AdaBoost, SGD, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) with oversampling for class imbalance and employs the One vs Rest approach for multiclass classification, evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: The research found that the amount of data alone doesn't determine performance; features like intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity are also crucial factors in classification effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a combined model using the One vs Rest approach can optimize classification performance for digital development documents, highlighting the importance of both data quantity and feature characteristics in NLP classification tasks.

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

TL;DR: DeepFHT is a survival analysis framework combining deep neural networks with first hitting time distributions from stochastic processes, representing time-to-event as diffusion process absorption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop interpretable survival models that capture time-varying risk without assuming proportional hazards, bridging stochastic process theory with deep learning.

Method: Neural networks map input features to FHT process parameters (initial condition, drift, diffusion), using Brownian motion processes with closed-form survival/hazard functions.

Result: Achieves predictive accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing physics-based interpretable parameterization of feature-risk relationships.

Conclusion: DeepFHT successfully combines stochastic process theory and deep learning for principled survival modeling in complex systems with interpretable parameters.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

*Marco Bagatella,Matteo Pirotta,Ahmed Touati,Alessandro Lazaric,Andrea Tirinzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TD-JEPA is a new unsupervised RL method that uses temporal difference learning to create latent representations predictive of long-term dynamics across multiple policies from offline data, enabling zero-shot reward optimization at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent prediction methods in RL are limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or on-policy data. The authors want to extend this to multi-task, multi-step prediction using offline data.

Method: TD-JEPA trains state/task encoders, policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and parameterized policies in latent space using temporal difference learning on offline transitions.

Result: Theoretically, TD-JEPA avoids collapse and learns low-rank factorization of policy dynamics. Empirically, it matches or outperforms SOTA baselines on 13 datasets in locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA enables effective zero-shot RL from pixels by learning predictive latent representations across multiple policies from offline data.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

*Nouha Karaouli,Denis Coquenet,Elisa Fromont,Martial Mermillod,Marina Reyboz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series foundation models have limited zero-shot capabilities and don't consistently outperform smaller dedicated models despite larger parameter counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether foundation models are effective for time series data given its inherent diversity, using forecasting as a test case.

Method: Analyzed zero-shot capabilities and fine-tuning performance of time series foundation models on forecasting tasks, comparing them with smaller dedicated models.

Result: Zero-shot performance is heavily dependent on pretraining domains, and fine-tuned foundation models don't consistently outperform smaller models relative to their increased complexity.

Conclusion: Foundation models are less suited for time series data due to its diversity, and dedicated smaller models often provide better performance-cost tradeoffs.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Result: Evaluated on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic task designed to test topological feature extraction capability. Results show LEAP-based encodings are effective for graph representation learning.

Conclusion: LEAP-based encodings demonstrate potential as powerful components for graph representation learning pipelines, addressing limitations of standard MPNNs through geometric-topological invariants.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

### [157] [Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761)
*Yicheng Lang,Yihua Zhang,Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Jinghan Jia,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM unlearning often suffers from fragile forgetting effects that can be easily reversed by post-unlearning manipulations. This paper shows that using lower-grade optimizers (zeroth-order or compressed-gradient methods) improves unlearning robustness by converging to harder-to-disturb loss landscape basins, and proposes a hybrid optimizer combining first-order and zeroth-order updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragility of LLM unlearning effects where post-unlearning manipulations like weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize intended forgetting, moving beyond prior approaches that focused on reformulating unlearning objectives.

Method: Investigates the role of optimizer 'grade' in unlearning robustness, showing that downgrading optimizers (using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants) improves resilience. Proposes a hybrid optimizer combining first-order and zeroth-order updates to preserve efficacy while enhancing robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms validate that the approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality. Zeroth-order and compressed-gradient optimizers demonstrate stronger robustness against post-training perturbations.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice significantly impacts LLM unlearning robustness, with lower-grade optimizers providing better resilience. The proposed hybrid optimizer effectively balances unlearning efficacy and robustness, offering a practical solution to the fragility problem in model unlearning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

*Youngbin Choi,Minjong Lee,Saemi Moon,Seunghyuk Cho,Chaehyeon Chung,MoonJeong Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-place feedback paradigm where users directly edit LLM responses achieves better performance with 79.1% fewer tokens compared to conventional multi-turn feedback in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedback paradigms in multi-turn reasoning rely on new messages, which LLMs struggle to integrate reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements and failure to precisely apply feedback to erroneous parts.

Method: Introduce in-place feedback where users directly edit the LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate revisions, rather than relying on new messages.

Result: Empirical evaluations show in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using 79.1% fewer tokens. It resolves the core limitation of multi-turn feedback by enabling precise application of feedback to erroneous parts.

Conclusion: In-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks, providing better performance with significant token efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

*Bastien Morel,Clément Moulin-Frier,Pascal Barla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to efficiently explore complex systems by maximizing pattern diversity within user-defined constraints, enabling interactive exploration while maintaining global diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems generate diverse patterns useful for science and art, but exploration is challenging due to large parameter spaces, non-linear parameter-pattern mappings, and user expectations for specific patterns.

Method: Provides design choices and implementation to maximize constrained diversity (pattern diversity within user's region of interest) using explicit, system-agnostic constraints formulated by users, in a sample-efficient manner.

Result: Enables interactive system exploration that leads to constrained diversity while maintaining global diversity across the parameter space.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenges of exploring complex systems by incorporating user expectations through explicit constraints, allowing efficient discovery of diverse patterns in regions of interest.

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

TL;DR: EvoMol-RL combines evolutionary algorithms with reinforcement learning using ECFPs to generate chemically valid molecules by learning context-aware mutation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing generative models that produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds in chemical space exploration.

Method: Extends EvoMol evolutionary algorithm with reinforcement learning, using Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs) to learn context-aware mutation policies for chemically plausible transformations.

Result: Significantly improves generation of valid and realistic molecules, reduces structural artifacts, enhances optimization performance, and outperforms baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism.

Conclusion: Combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints is effective for generating chemically relevant molecular structures.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

*Federico Cinus,Yuko Kuroki,Atsushi Miyauchi,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies minimizing polarization and disagreement in online opinion dynamics using bandit algorithms, achieving sublinear regret with a two-stage approach combining subspace estimation and linear bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work assumes full knowledge of users' innate opinions, but real-world social media interventions face incomplete information where innate opinions must be learned sequentially through observations.

Method: Proposes a two-stage algorithm based on low-rank matrix bandits: first performs subspace estimation to identify low-dimensional structure, then uses linear bandit algorithm within the compact representation from estimated subspace.

Result: The algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret over time horizon $T$, and empirical results show it significantly outperforms linear bandit baseline in both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: This work establishes a connection between social media interventions and multi-armed bandits, providing an effective online approach for minimizing polarization under incomplete information.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

*Rui Zhu,Xuan Yu,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating enhanced MCTS into GFlowNets sampling to improve high-reward sample generation while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions, needing better exploitation-diversity balance.

Method: Enhanced MCTS with PUCT for exploration-exploitation balance and controllable greediness mechanism integrated into GFlowNets sampling.

Result: Accelerated discovery of high-reward regions and continuous generation of high-reward samples while preserving diversity.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity in GFlowNets through dynamic exploration-reward balance.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to continual adaptation and their susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Using synthetic datasets with varying periodic structures, fine-tuning TSFMs sequentially on multiple datasets and measuring adaptation-retention trade-off.

Result: Fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks but causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, demonstrating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: TSFMs face a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning scenarios, highlighting the need for improved adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes learning dynamic guidance weights for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models, making them functions of conditioning, denoising time, and target time, to improve distributional alignment while maintaining perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static CFG weights improve visual quality but harm distributional alignment. The authors aim to better approximate the target conditional distribution by learning adaptive guidance weights.

Method: Learn guidance weights as continuous functions of conditioning c, current time t, and target time s. Minimize distributional mismatch between noised samples from true conditional distribution and guided diffusion samples. Extend to reward-guided sampling using reward functions on clean data.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image generation. Improved FID scores and better image-prompt alignment in text-to-image applications using CLIP score as reward.

Conclusion: Dynamic guidance weights significantly improve distributional alignment in diffusion models while maintaining or enhancing perceptual quality, with particular benefits for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

*Luckeciano C. Melo,Alessandro Abate,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPO is a curvature-aware policy optimization method that improves RL training stability for LLMs by identifying and masking unstable samples, achieving 30x sample efficiency improvement over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods in RL for LLMs suffer from optimization instability, forcing conservative hyperparameters that increase computational costs and reduce sample efficiency.

Method: Formalizes policy gradient optimization with second-order geometry, tracks curvature information during updates, and uses data selection to mask samples that cause unstable updates.

Result: CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning regimes where baselines fail catastrophically, achieving up to 30x sample efficiency improvement with minimal intervention (rejecting <8% of tokens).

Conclusion: Curvature-aware optimization enables more stable and sample-efficient RL training for LLMs, unlocking scalable post-training capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To select the best LLM for each query while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost efficiently.

Method: Formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits with pairwise preference feedback. Introduce CCFT for model embeddings using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. Apply FGTS.CDB algorithm.

Result: Lower cumulative regret and faster convergence on RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than OpenAI embedding baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM routing framework with CCFT and FGTS.CDB effectively balances performance and cost, outperforming strong baselines.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Motivation: To address the challenge of missing information in microsamples due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints, enabling population synthesis with incomplete data.

Method: Uses Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) with a mask matrix to represent missing values, allowing training on datasets with incomplete information.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates synthetic populations that closely resemble both models trained with complete data and the actual population, validated using Swedish national travel survey data.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a robust solution for population synthesis with incomplete data and demonstrates the potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to

TL;DR: CT-GAN deep generative model outperforms traditional FBS-CO for target population synthesis in transportation planning, with hybrid CT-GAN+FBS-CO approach showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic population synthesis methods face challenges with high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues when generating populations for target scenarios in transportation and urban planning.

Method: Used Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) to create target populations directly from marginal constraints, and developed a hybrid method combining CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO).

Result: Stand-alone CT-GAN performed best overall, generating realistic single-variable distributions but struggling with multi-variable relationships. Hybrid CT-GAN+FBS-CO improved over FBS-CO alone by using CT-GAN for base population generation and FBS-CO for refinement.

Conclusion: CT-GAN is an effective methodology for target population synthesis, and deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional techniques to enhance performance.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Conclusion: Visual analytics provides a scalable framework for data quality inspection and plays a critical role in enhancing the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of AI models in energy management systems.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) is a new architectural block that separates structural and quantitative knowledge in MLPs, achieving ~40% faster training while maintaining or exceeding MLP accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the entanglement of structural knowledge (ReLU activation patterns) and quantitative knowledge (weights/biases) in conventional MLPs, which limits training efficiency.

Method: GLAI fixes the structural knowledge once stabilized and reformulates MLPs as path combinations, optimizing only the quantitative component while preserving universal approximation capabilities.

Result: GLAI reduces training time by ~40% on average, matches or exceeds MLP accuracy with equivalent parameters, and converges faster across diverse experimental setups.

Conclusion: GLAI establishes a new design principle for efficient neural network training that can potentially replace MLPs in large-scale architectures like Transformers.

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how different loss functions affect value-based reinforcement learning methods, finding that mean absolute error is theoretically better than mean squared error for policy suboptimality control, and that cross-entropy losses outperform squared loss in linear RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of different loss functions in value-based reinforcement learning methods and determine which loss functions are better aligned with different regression objectives for controlling policy suboptimality.

Method: Theoretical analysis of prediction objectives (mean absolute error vs mean squared error) and empirical evaluation of different loss functions (binary/categorical cross-entropy vs squared loss) in linear reinforcement learning settings.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows mean absolute error is better than mean squared error for controlling policy suboptimality gap. Empirical evidence demonstrates that algorithms minimizing cross-entropy losses outperform those based on squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Mean absolute error is theoretically superior to mean squared error for value-based RL, and cross-entropy loss functions aligned with mean absolute error outperform traditional squared loss approaches in practice.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is crucial for gene expression data analysis to enhance classification performance and reduce computational costs for high-dimensional datasets.

Method: Proposes BoMGene, a hybrid method integrating Boruta and mRMR feature selection techniques, tested on 25 gene expression datasets using SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and GBM classifiers.

Result: The Boruta-mRMR combination reduces feature count compared to mRMR alone, speeds up training time, and maintains or improves classification accuracy over individual methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows clear advantages in accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene expression data analysis.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene

TL;DR: RiskPO introduces risk-based policy optimization to address entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains in LLM post-training, using Mixed Value-at-Risk objectives and bundling schemes to enhance exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing mean-based methods like GRPO suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains by overemphasizing high-probability outputs while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths.

Method: Proposes Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO) with Mixed Value-at-Risk objectives that integrate weighted attention over multiple reward regions, plus a bundling scheme that aggregates questions into bundles for richer feedback.

Result: Achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: Risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities by preventing overconfident convergence and promoting exploration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### [175] [Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00915)
*Xin-Qiang Cai,Wei Wang,Feng Liu,Tongliang Liu,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR trains policies using automated verifiers instead of human labeling. Binary rewards introduce false negatives and false positives. The paper proposes backward and forward correction algorithms to handle verifier errors, showing improved performance in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of binary rewards in RLVR systems which cause false negatives (rejecting correct answers) and false positives (accepting incorrect answers), making training unreliable.

Method: Model verifier as stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. Derive backward correction (de-biasing observed rewards) and forward correction (reweighting score-function terms using only FN rate). Implement as hooks in GRPO-based RLVR pipeline.

Result: Both corrections outperform uncorrected training across models and datasets. Forward correction converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Lightweight LLM verifier estimating FN rate online achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed correction algorithms effectively mitigate verifier unreliability in RLVR systems, with forward correction being particularly efficient and stable, enabling practical deployment with improved performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RECAP is a reinforcement learning method that trains large reasoning models to override flawed chain-of-thought reasoning and reroute to safe responses, improving safety alignment without additional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models lack critical reasoning about safety alignment and are easily biased when flawed premises are injected into their thought process, making them vulnerable to jailbreaks.

Method: RECAP uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to train on synthetically generated counter-aligned chain-of-thought prefills and standard prompts, teaching models to override flawed reasoning trajectories.

Result: RECAP substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, preserves core reasoning capability, maintains inference token budget, and shows increased self-reflection frequency and robustness under adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: RECAP provides an effective post-training method for robust safety alignment that maintains model performance while significantly enhancing safety against reasoning-based attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM) extends consistency models to Riemannian manifolds, enabling few-step generation while respecting intrinsic manifold constraints through covariant derivatives and exponential maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency models work well on Euclidean domains like images but face challenges on Riemannian manifolds due to curved geometry, limiting their applications to non-Euclidean spaces.

Method: Proposes RCM using covariant derivative and exponential-map parameterization, derives closed-form training objectives, establishes equivalence between RCD (teacher-based) and RCT (conditional vector field) variants, and introduces simplified training without complex differential calculations.

Result: RCM demonstrates superior generative quality in few-step generation across various non-Euclidean manifolds including flat-tori, spheres, and 3D rotation group SO(3).

Conclusion: RCM successfully extends consistency modeling to Riemannian manifolds, providing both theoretical foundations and practical solutions for few-step generation on curved geometries.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes S-SWIM, a novel algorithm for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using Random Feature Methods, avoiding gradient approximation of spike functions and achieving high performance on time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient alternatives to ANNs but difficult to train due to non-differentiable spike mechanisms. Current gradient-based methods require approximations that complicate training.

Method: Adapts Random Feature Methods from ANNs to Spike Response Model SNNs, creating S-SWIM algorithm for end-to-end training without spike gradient approximation.

Result: S-SWIM achieves high accuracies on time series forecasting as standalone method and serves as effective initialization for gradient-based training. Outperforms random weight sampling.

Conclusion: S-SWIM provides fast, interpretable, and high-performance SNN training alternative that avoids gradient approximation issues and enables effective initialization for subsequent optimization.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for sequential medical testing that minimizes costly diagnostic tests while ensuring misclassification rates don't exceed a tolerance α, achieving O(√T) excess tests compared to oracle baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costs in medical screening by minimizing expensive diagnostic tests while maintaining safety guarantees on classification error rates, addressing the trade-off between testing costs and prediction accuracy.

Method: Developed an algorithm that interleaves label collection and distribution estimation, computes conservative data-driven thresholds on logistic scores to decide when testing is necessary, and estimates both model parameters θ* and context distribution P.

Result: The procedure guarantees with probability 1-δ that misclassification rate doesn't exceed α, requiring only O(√T) excess tests compared to an oracle baseline that knows both θ* and patient feature distribution P.

Conclusion: Establishes first no-regret guarantees for error-constrained logistic testing, with practical applications in cost-sensitive medical screening, showing efficient parameter estimation while maintaining safety guarantees without excessive testing.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Motivation: To develop a geometric scattering transform that maintains equivariance with respect to rigid-body roto-translations (SE(3) symmetry) for graphs containing both scalar and vector node features, enabling more efficient geometric graph neural networks.

Method: Introduces a novel geometric scattering transform that is SE(3)-equivariant and incorporates it into a geometric graph neural network framework, leveraging scattering-based approaches rather than traditional message-passing.

Result: The equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves performance comparable to other equivariant message-passing GNNs while using only a fraction of the parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric scattering transform provides an effective and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional equivariant message-passing GNNs for geometric graphs with mixed scalar and vector features.

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for
geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new
scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body
roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a
geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant
scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant
message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explains why meaningless tokens improve LLM reasoning and proposes ARM, a lightweight inference-time method that redistributes activations to achieve similar benefits without altering input sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The puzzling observation that inserting meaningless tokens before queries enhances LLM reasoning performance, seeking to understand the underlying mechanism and develop a principled method for similar gains.

Method: Proposes Activation Redistribution Module (ARM) - a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly by identifying near-zero activations after non-linear functions and shifting them outward, reproducing the effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures show ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks with minimal implementation complexity.

Conclusion: Provides mechanistic explanation for meaningless token benefits and delivers ARM as a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to improve LLM performance.

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

TL;DR: CurES is an efficient curriculum learning method for LLMs that optimizes prompt selection and rollout allocation through reinforcement learning gradient optimization, achieving significant performance improvements over GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curriculum learning methods fail to adequately account for prompt difficulty variations and use simplistic filtering mechanisms, leading to computational waste.

Method: Approach from RL gradient optimization perspective; identify prompt selection and rollout allocation as key factors; use theoretical analysis to guide sampling distribution and rollout quantity allocation; propose CurES with Bayesian posterior estimation.

Result: CurES outperforms GRPO by +3.30 points with 1.5B model and +4.82 points with 7B model; exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CurES provides an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and minimizes computational overhead through systematic optimization of prompt selection and rollout allocation.

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated X-TFC is a novel framework that improves upon X-TFC by using a soft, learned domain decomposition with differentiable logistic gates to dynamically adapt RBF kernel widths, achieving superior accuracy and computational efficiency for boundary layer problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs and X-TFC struggle with sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems. X-TFC avoids multi-objective optimization but remains inefficient for boundary layers and incompatible with domain decomposition.

Method: Proposes Gated X-TFC with soft learned domain decomposition using differentiable logistic gates that dynamically adapt RBF kernel widths across the domain, eliminating interface penalties. Also introduces operator-conditioned meta-learning for fast warm-starting.

Result: On 1D convection-diffusion benchmark: order-of-magnitude lower error than standard X-TFC, 80% fewer collocation points, 66% reduction in training time. Successfully demonstrated on twin boundary-layer equation and 2D Poisson problem with sharp Gaussian source.

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC provides a simple, accurate and computationally efficient alternative to PINNs for challenging boundary-layer regimes, with scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

TL;DR: This paper studies secret elicitation - discovering hidden knowledge in AI models that they possess but don't explicitly state. The authors train LLMs with specific secret knowledge, then test various black-box and white-box techniques to extract this hidden information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to discover knowledge that AI models possess but deliberately conceal or don't verbalize directly, which has important implications for AI safety and transparency.

Method: Trained three families of LLMs with specific secret knowledge, then designed and tested various black-box (prefill attacks) and white-box (logit lens, sparse autoencoders) techniques for secret elicitation.

Result: Prefill attacks were most effective in 2/3 settings, while white-box techniques (logit lens and SAEs) performed best in the remaining setting. Many techniques improved on simple baselines.

Conclusion: The study establishes a public benchmark for evaluating secret elicitation methods and shows that both black-box and white-box approaches can be effective for discovering hidden knowledge in AI models.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Motivation: Current DR diagnostic methods are resource-intensive, and image-based AI tools have limitations in early-stage detection, creating need for alternative non-image approaches.

Method: Two-level ensemble: first stage uses hyperparameter-tuned base models (Linear SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) with internal stacking; second stage aggregates predictions using Random Forest as meta-learner.

specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

### [186] [Multi-Actor Multi-Critic Deep Deterministic Reinforcement Learning with a Novel Q-Ensemble Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01083)
*Andy Wu,Chun-Cheng Lin,Rung-Tzuo Liaw,Yuehua Huang,Chihjung Kuo,Chia Tong Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel Multi-Actor Multi-Critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method that uses multiple actors and critics with non-dominated sorting, quantile-based ensemble evaluation, and skill-based actor selection to address overestimation/underestimation issues in continuous control problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation that few studies have considered architectures with multiple actors together with multiple critics in actor-critic reinforcement learning, particularly for handling huge discrete or continuous state/action spaces in real-world applications.

Method: Multi-actor multi-critic architecture with three key features: 1) Actor selection using non-dominated sorting based on skill and creativity factors, 2) Quantile-based ensemble strategy for evaluating actors and critics, 3) Exploitation of actors with best skill factor.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic reinforcement learning methods on MuJoCo benchmark, with experimental analysis confirming the effectiveness of proposed components and empirical analysis showing benefits on complicated problems.

Conclusion: The MAMC method provides stable learning with bounded estimation bias, effectively addresses overestimation/underestimation issues, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel VAE-based method for learning stochastic dynamical systems from data, estimating both state trajectories and noise time series, with teacher forcing for improved multi-step prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems from observed data is important across scientific fields, but existing autoencoder-based approaches have limitations for stochastic systems.

Method: Uses variational autoencoders for dynamical systems to estimate both system state trajectories and noise time series from data, incorporates teacher forcing strategy for multi-step system evolution.

Result: Demonstrated performance on six test problems with simulated and experimental data, showed effects of teacher forcing interval on internal dynamics, compared favorably to deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed VAE-based approach with teacher forcing effectively learns stochastic dynamical systems and overcomes limitations of traditional autoencoder methods for stochastic modeling.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

### [188] [Geometric Properties of Neural Multivariate Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01105)
*George Andriopoulos,Zixuan Dong,Bimarsha Adhikari,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural collapse in regression degrades performance, unlike in classification. Performance depends on whether feature intrinsic dimension (ID_H) is smaller or larger than target dimension (ID_Y), creating over-compressed and under-compressed regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why neural collapse harms regression performance while benefiting classification, and to characterize the geometric properties of learned representations in neural multivariate regression.

Method: Analyze models through intrinsic dimension estimation of last-layer features (ID_H) and regression targets (ID_Y) across control tasks and synthetic datasets, comparing collapsed vs non-collapsed models.

Result: Collapsed models show ID_H < ID_Y leading to over-compression and poor generalization, while non-collapsed models maintain ID_H > ID_Y. Performance depends on data quantity and noise levels, revealing two distinct regimes.

Conclusion: The study provides geometric insights into neural regression and practical strategies for improving generalization by managing feature dimensionality relative to target complexity.

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

*Felix Parker,Nimeesha Chan,Chi Zhang,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TsLLM is a time series-augmented LLM that bridges numerical time series analysis with natural language understanding through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture, enabling tasks like contextual forecasting, time series QA, and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series models cannot process text, while LLMs struggle with numerical time series data. There's a need to combine time series perception with language understanding for tasks requiring both numerical analysis and natural language interaction.

Method: Augment an LLM with specialized time series perception using patch-based encoder-decoder architecture, trained on over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples covering diverse analysis tasks.

Result: TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring integration of time series analysis with natural language, though not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

*Kassahun Azezew,Minyechil Alehegn,Tsega Asresa,Bitew Mekuria,Tizazu Bayh,Ayenew Kassie,Amsalu Tesema,Animut Embiyale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A3-FL framework uses attention mechanism in federated learning to handle non-IID biometric data, achieving better accuracy and privacy than standard FL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric data is sensitive and centralized training poses privacy risks. Federated learning provides privacy-preserving alternative but struggles with interpretability and heterogeneous data.

Method: Adds attention mechanism at central server to weight local model updates based on significance. Uses differential privacy and secure update protocols. Evaluated with FVC2004 fingerprint data using Siamese-CNN for feature extraction.

Result: A3-FL achieved 0.8413 accuracy, outperforming FedAvg (0.8164), Local-only (0.7664), and Centralized (0.7997). Maintained 0.8330 accuracy with differential privacy. Showed superior convergence speed and robustness.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable and privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in distributed environments.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS is a framework that trains LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning on time series tasks using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, achieving improved performance through explicit reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series models lack explicit multi-step reasoning capabilities needed for complex tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting, while existing LLM reasoning advances focus mainly on mathematical and coding domains.

Method: Uses Residual Vector-Quantized VAE for discrete time series tokenization, followed by two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis, then Group Relative Policy Optimization with CoT prompting strategies.

Result: The RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks.

Conclusion: COUNTS opens new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning by enabling explicit multi-step reasoning in time series analysis.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes transforming biological sequence features into hyperboloid space to better capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures, then computing kernel matrices for improved sequence analysis and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning methods struggle with capturing complex relationships and hierarchical structures in genomic sequence data when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, limiting accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement.

Method: Transform biological sequence feature representations into hyperboloid space to preserve inherent structural information, then compute kernel matrices based on hyperboloid features using inner products of feature vectors to measure sequence similarities.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates the approach effectively captures important sequence correlations and improves classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Mapping biological sequences to hyperboloid space enables better representation of complex relationships and hierarchical structures, leading to more effective sequence analysis and improved classification performance.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), a method that generates multiple draft solutions in parallel, distills them into a bounded workspace, and refines them iteratively to achieve better accuracy than long chain-of-thought reasoning while reducing context length and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning improves accuracy but increases context length, token/compute cost, and latency. The paper aims to find better trade-offs on this Pareto frontier by leveraging models' metacognition capabilities.

Method: Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR): (1) generate diverse drafts in parallel, (2) distill them into a bounded textual workspace, (3) refine conditioned on this workspace. Also explores Sequential Refinement (SR) as a subcase with parallelism degree 1.

Result: PDR achieves better accuracy than long CoT with lower latency. On math tasks, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines, with PDR delivering largest gains (+11% on AIME 2024, +9% on AIME 2025).

Conclusion: Model orchestrations like PDR can shift the Pareto frontier, and training models with RL to be consistent with such inference methods further improves performance, demonstrating the potential of controlled iterative refinement over single-pass reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabINR is an auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation framework for tabular data imputation that uses learnable row and feature embeddings to handle discrete structures and provide instance adaptive imputations without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular datasets are often incomplete due to collection errors, privacy restrictions, or sensor failures. Simple imputation strategies introduce bias or distort data distributions, requiring high-quality imputers that are robust across dataset sizes and provide fast inference.

Method: TabINR models tables as neural functions using an auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation framework. It introduces learnable row and feature embeddings to handle discrete tabular data structure, enabling instance adaptive imputations from partial observations without modifying the trained model.

Result: Evaluation across 12 real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms shows consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming classical methods (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning models (GAIN, ReMasker), with clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: TabINR provides an effective neural representation framework for tabular data imputation that delivers high-quality results across diverse datasets and missingness scenarios, particularly excelling on high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Motivation: DP-SGD's added noise disrupts gradient low-rank structure, increasing entropy and slowing optimization in private LLM fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed a post-processing algorithm based on random matrix theory to denoise gradients and restore low-rank structure in DP-SGD.

Result: Applied to RoBERTa fine-tuning on GLUE tasks, the method improves sample efficiency and reduces training time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Matrix recovery techniques can enhance utility of private language model training without compromising privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: A novel Hamilton-Jacobi equation-based framework for optimal transport that uses neural networks to learn bidirectional transport maps without numerical integration or adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and principled approach to optimal transport that avoids computational complexity of traditional methods while maintaining provable optimality.

Method: Uses Hamilton-Jacobi equation characteristics to derive closed-form transport maps, trains a single neural network with characteristic-derived loss function in pure minimization framework.

Result: Achieves accurate, scalable, and efficient optimal transport across diverse datasets, supporting various cost functions and class-conditional transport.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, versatile tool for optimal transport applications with guaranteed convergence to optimal maps and reduced computational burden.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALI-CFM is a novel flow matching method that uses adversarial learning to infer smooth trajectories from discrete time observations, outperforming existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning dynamics from sampled observations at discrete time points is challenging when ground-truth trajectories are unavailable. Existing multi-marginal trajectory inference algorithms have limitations that need to be addressed.

Method: ALI-CFM uses a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves between source and target points, ensuring marginal distributions at intermediate time points match observed distributions. The resulting smooth interpolants are then marginalized by flow matching to train a vector field for the underlying dynamics.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory prediction. The interpolants are shown to be unique under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM provides a versatile and scalable approach for trajectory inference from discrete time observations, demonstrating superior performance on complex biological datasets while maintaining competitive performance on standard tasks.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

*Haizhong Zheng,Jiawei Zhao,Bedi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO enables stable off-policy RL training for large language models by constraining second-moment importance weights, achieving on-policy performance even with 256-step stale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs rely on on-policy training which is inefficient and unscalable, while existing off-policy methods degrade with stale data.

Method: M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization) constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress extreme outliers while preserving informative updates from stale data.

Result: M2PO reduces clipped tokens from 1.22% to 0.06% under high staleness, maintains stable optimization, and matches on-policy performance across six models (1.7B-32B) and eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: M2PO enables effective off-policy RL training for LLMs by properly exploiting stale data, achieving scalability without performance degradation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

*Waïss Azizian,Ali Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how statistical properties of pretraining distributions shape in-context learning (ICL) capabilities in LLMs, developing a theoretical framework and empirical validation for numerical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL works effectively in LLMs despite limited theoretical understanding, and to clarify how pretraining distribution properties influence ICL performance.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework unifying task selection and generalization, generalized Bayesian posterior consistency for heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, and conducted empirical studies on numerical tasks like stochastic differential equations.

Result: Showed that distributional properties (tail behavior, coverage) govern ICL sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness. Found that controlling statistical properties of pretraining data is crucial for ICL performance.

Conclusion: Controlling key statistical properties of pretraining distributions is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable LLMs, with distributional characteristics directly impacting learning capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

*Jože M. Rožanec,Tina Žezlin,Laurentiu Vasiliu,Dunja Mladenić,Radu Prodan,Dumitru Roman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fiaingen introduces novel time series generation techniques that create synthetic financial data closely mirroring real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data similarity, downstream task performance, and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial data is limited in quantity, quality, and variety, which hinders machine learning model performance for trading and investment applications. Generative methods can address this data shortage.

Method: A set of novel techniques for time series data generation called Fiaingen, evaluated across three criteria: overlap in reduced dimensionality space, downstream ML task performance, and runtime performance.

Result: Fiaingen achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three criteria. Synthetic data closely mirrors original time series, generation time is close to seconds, and models trained on synthetic data achieve performance close to real-world data training.

Conclusion: Fiaingen provides an effective and scalable solution for generating synthetic financial time series data that can mitigate data shortages while maintaining model performance comparable to real data training.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

### [201] [On the Benefits of Weight Normalization for Overparameterized Matrix Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01175)
*Yudong Wei,Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight normalization with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence and exponential speedup in overparameterized matrix sensing, with improved iteration and sample complexity as overparameterization increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization techniques are widely used but theoretically poorly understood. This work aims to establish the theoretical benefits of weight normalization in overparameterized matrix sensing.

Method: Apply generalized weight normalization with Riemannian optimization to the overparameterized matrix sensing problem.

Result: Proves linear convergence and exponential speedup over standard methods without WN. Both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially with increased overparameterization.

Conclusion: This is the first work characterizing how weight normalization leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

*Gaoxiang Luo,Aryan Deshwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes COM-BOM, a multi-objective optimization method for exemplar selection that jointly optimizes for both predictive accuracy and model calibration in in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior exemplar selection methods only optimize for predictive accuracy, neglecting model calibration which is crucial for trustworthy and safe deployment of AI systems.

Method: Formulate exemplar selection as multi-objective optimization problem and solve it using Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find Pareto front trading off accuracy and calibration.

Result: COM-BOM beats or matches baselines at jointly optimizing accuracy and calibration on MMLU-Pro benchmark tasks, while requiring minimal LLM API calls.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization approach for exemplar selection effectively balances accuracy and calibration, providing more trustworthy in-context learning with efficient computation.

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

### [203] [Temporal Score Rescaling for Temperature Sampling in Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01184)
*Yanbo Xu,Yu Wu,Sungjae Park,Zhizhuo Zhou,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to control sampling diversity in diffusion and flow matching models by rescaling score functions, enabling sampling from sharper or broader distributions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide users with control over sampling diversity in generative models, allowing adjustment of distribution sharpness for different tasks without model modifications.

Method: Rescaling learned score functions of noisy data distributions to control local sampling temperature, compatible with existing models and samplers.

Result: Validated on 2D data and applied to image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and protein design, showing task-specific performance improvements.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective control over sampling diversity across diverse tasks, with different optimal temperature settings for different applications.

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

*Leyla Mirvakhabova,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi,Gaurav Kumar,Hanxue Liang,Wanru Zhao,Paul Whatmough*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSL is a novel router regularization technique that shapes routing probability distributions to match a target Dirichlet prior, improving expert specialization in upcycled MoE models without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse MoEs often suffers from poor expert specialization due to naive weight replication and low-confidence routing, hindering performance.

Method: Introduces Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL) that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert assignments to a target Dirichlet prior, enabling fine-grained control over expert balance and specialization.

Result: Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models show DPSL consistently outperforms existing upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPSL addresses the critical issue of poor specialization in upcycled MoEs, fostering more adaptive and higher-performing models, and is a general tool applicable beyond MoE training.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

Conclusion: ToolBrain provides a user-friendly, extensible framework that reduces barriers for adapting LLM-based agents to specific domains, enabling efficient tool-use training and performance gains.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from computational inefficiencies due to overthinking, and existing methods struggle to balance reasoning quality with inference cost reduction.

Method: ARS uses multi-checkpoint certainty estimation with progressive suppression thresholds to dynamically identify and suppress redundant reasoning steps without additional training.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARS provides an effective training-free solution for improving computational efficiency in large reasoning models through adaptive reasoning suppression.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

TL;DR: NeurIPS should actively catalyze scientific consensus on AI policy by learning from IPCC's approach to climate policy consensus, addressing the current void in consensus formation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a complete void in consensus formation mechanisms for AI policy, and designing wise AI policy requires rigorous evidence and scientific consensus.

Method: Recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from IPCC's leadership in building scientific consensus on climate policy.

Result: Identifies NeurIPS as the best option for catalyzing AI policy consensus due to its strengths and lack of compelling alternatives.

Conclusion: NeurIPS should champion scientific consensus to create higher quality AI policy, as it leads AI on many fronts and policy engagement is within its business scope.

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Specifically, we present: (i) semantic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for
structured AI lifecycle management, (ii) ontology-driven data lineage tracking
to ensure traceability and accountability, and (iii) regulatory operations
(RegOps) workflows to operationalize compliance requirements. By implementing
and validating its solutions across diverse pilots, CERTAIN aims to advance
regulatory compliance and to promote responsible AI innovation aligned with

### [210] [Judging by Appearances? Auditing and Intervening Vision-Language Models for Bail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00088)
*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper audits vision language models (VLMs) for bail decision prediction, finding they perform poorly and wrongly deny bail with high confidence. The authors develop interventions using RAG pipelines and fine-tuning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of VLMs, legal judgment systems could potentially use criminal images alongside text reports, but this could lead to harmful consequences and misuse. The authors want to investigate VLM efficiency in bail prediction.

Method: The authors audit standalone VLMs for bail prediction, then design interventions including: 1) incorporating legal precedents through RAG pipelines, and 2) fine-tuning VLMs using innovative schemes.

Result: Standalone VLMs perform poorly across intersectional groups and wrongly deny bail to deserving individuals with high confidence. The proposed interventions substantially improve bail prediction performance.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the need for smart interventions on VLMs before real-world deployment in legal judgment prediction, and provides a foundation for designing such interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reasoning and dataset construction are valuable for advancing robust financial fraud detection in real-world regulatory applications.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

Motivation: Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding recovery rules, which cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly become incomplete.

Method: Use embodied AI powered by large visual language models to provide commonsense reasoning for assessing context and generating appropriate actions in real time, demonstrated in a simulated urban benchmark in Unreal Engine.

Result: Drones can dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings, enabling adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines.

Conclusion: Embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate

a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with

*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel is a fine-tuned model for generating robust, portable, and execution-validated database queries, addressing challenges in natural language to SQL transformation through synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language to SQL transformation faces challenges in correctness due to precise schema linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while training supervision is limited to sequence-level execution success and result matching.

Method: Thinkquel integrates a synthetic data pipeline (TS-SQL) using dbt as portable intermediate representation with span-aware reinforcement learning (Token-Sequence GRPO) to bridge token-level training and sequence-level execution rewards.

Result: On TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) achieves 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match, improving over base model by 67.2% (execution) and 44.4% (match). In Spider experiments, TS-GRPO improves training stability and convergence.

Conclusion: Thinkquel demonstrates significant improvements in generating execution-validated SQL queries through synthetic data generation and novel reinforcement learning approaches that better align token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualTune: A decoupled fine-tuning approach that separates tool calling into tool selection and argument generation tasks, using dedicated LoRA adapters to significantly improve local LLM performance in agent orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLMs underperform frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with tool selection from large sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameters, creating need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective on-device solutions.

Method: Decoupled fine-tuning using LoRA adapters with separate loss masking for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation, plus DualTune inference framework that dynamically loads corresponding adapters and implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict tool selection scope.

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B model trained with decoupled fine-tuning improves tool calling accuracy by 46%, outperforms similar-sized models in all cases and often beats models 2x larger on MCP-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach effectively addresses local LLM limitations in tool calling, enabling efficient agent orchestration on end-user devices while maintaining privacy and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

### [216] [MAGIC-MASK: Multi-Agent Guided Inter-Agent Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00274)
*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGIC-MASK is a multi-agent explainability framework that extends perturbation-based explanation to MARL, using inter-agent collaboration, saliency-guided masking, and mathematical formalisms to improve explanation fidelity and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of prior explainability methods (computational cost, limited exploration, lack of multi-agent adaptation) for deploying DRL agents in safety-critical and multi-agent environments.

Method: Integrates PPO, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration for sharing masked state information and peer experience. Uses trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and KL divergence regularization with probabilistic modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness on single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks (highway driving, Google Research Football).

Conclusion: Successfully generalizes explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems through unified mathematical framework, providing interpretable and transferable explanations while improving learning performance.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL guides improve task-specific performance but create trade-offs with reasoning flexibility, showing optimized fragility where accuracy drops significantly on complex reasoning problems while maintaining high performance on general knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains and understand their impact on cross-domain cognitive abilities, which remains unexplored.

Method: Used six GPT-OSS:20b model variants (baseline and five ICL configurations) tested on 840 tasks spanning general knowledge, logic riddles, and mathematical olympiad problems, with statistical analysis via ANOVA.

Result: ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge but dropped to 10-43% on riddles (vs 43% baseline), showing significant behavioral modifications (p<0.001). No significant differences on olympiad problem (p=0.2173).

Conclusion: ICL guides create systematic trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important implications for LLM deployment and AI safety due to optimized fragility phenomenon.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

*Thierry Blankenstein,Jialin Yu,Zixuan Li,Vassilis Plachouras,Sunando Sengupta,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show systematic bias in selecting functionally equivalent tools from marketplaces, favoring certain providers and earlier-listed options, which creates fairness issues in tool-augmented LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in LLM agents' tool selection from marketplaces where multiple providers offer equivalent tools, as biased selection can degrade user experience and distort competition.

Method: Created a benchmark with diverse tool categories containing functionally equivalent tools, tested 7 models, conducted controlled experiments on tool features/metadata/pre-training exposure, and proposed a lightweight mitigation approach.

Result: Found significant unfairness in tool selection with models fixating on single providers or preferring earlier-listed tools; semantic alignment between queries and metadata is strongest predictor; description perturbations significantly shift selections; pre-training exposure amplifies bias.

Conclusion: Tool-selection bias is a key obstacle for fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs, and the proposed lightweight mitigation (filtering then uniform sampling) effectively reduces bias while maintaining task coverage.

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

*Zeshi Dai,Zimo Peng,Zerui Cheng,Ryan Yihe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA benchmark reveals AI models' critical inability to operate in adversarial environments like crypto markets, where they achieve only 28% accuracy without tools and plateau at 67.4% with tools, showing systematic preference for unreliable information sources despite access to authoritative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks fail to evaluate performance in adversarial, high-stakes environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible, as demonstrated by $30 billion crypto losses in 2024.

Method: Evaluated 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks in crypto markets, requiring agents to distinguish truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information, and make irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.

Result: Models achieve only 28% accuracy without tools, improve to 67.4% with tools but plateau below 80% human baseline. Models systematically prefer unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized misinformation even when correct answers are accessible.

Conclusion: Current AI models remain fundamentally unprepared for adversarial environments despite impressive reasoning scores. Adversarial robustness is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy, with implications extending to cybersecurity, content moderation, and other domains with active adversaries.

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

TL;DR: Critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models for transformers, examining design choices and presenting variants that achieve better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in sequential tasks but struggle with logical reasoning, possibly due to unexplored creative uses like latent space and recurrent reasoning. Hierarchical Reasoning Models show promise but need deeper investigation.

Method: Performed critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models, examined key design choices, and developed intriguing variants of the model.

Result: Achieved significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported, with surprising observations.

Conclusion: The work raises intriguing directions for further research in transformer-based logical reasoning models using latent space and recurrent approaches.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework with three techniques: semantic adaptation transmission, semantic lightweight transmission, and semantic self-evolution control to enable efficient multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With communication targets shifting from humans to AI agents, there's a need for new paradigms that enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration. Semantic communication offers promise but faces constraints from dynamic environments and limited resources.

Method: 1) Semantic adaptation transmission using fine-tuning with real/generative samples; 2) Semantic lightweight transmission using pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling; 3) Semantic self-evolution control using distributed hierarchical decision-making for multi-dimensional resource optimization.

Result: Simulation results show faster convergence, stronger robustness, and the distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-driven framework and three enabling techniques demonstrate strong potential for AI agent communication networks by addressing dynamic environment challenges and resource constraints.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

TL;DR: TRACE framework enables dynamic evolution of agent benchmarks by transforming existing tasks into more complex versions through agent exploration, ensuring validatable trajectories for reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks are quickly becoming obsolete as new agents rapidly reach performance ceilings, creating a need for more challenging and sustainable evaluation systems.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) evolutionary proposal mining through preliminary exploration, (2) problem formation and free exploration with trajectory recording, (3) multi-level validation to ensure reproducibility and validity.

Result: Experiments on GAIA benchmark show TRACE consistently enhances task complexity while improving evaluation reliability through validatable execution trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, self-evolving benchmark systems, providing sustainable and challenging evaluation for ongoing agent development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

TL;DR: Automated evaluation of AI responses to patient health questions can closely match expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers, enabling scalable assessment of AI systems for patient-clinician communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gold standard evaluation using human expert review is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability for assessing AI systems that answer patient health questions.

Method: Conducted systematic study across 100 patient cases with responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total), assessing three dimensions: question answering, appropriate use of clinical note evidence, and use of general medical knowledge.

Result: Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics, automated rankings closely matched expert ratings.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDMS proposes a semantically enriched state representation with relational variables and action masking for invasion sports like soccer, enabling interpretable player-level agent models that outperform baselines in prediction accuracy and tactical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based analyses are intuitive but limited, while modern ML models lack explicit agent representations and tactical interpretability. The challenge is to build player-level agent models that are both interpretable and robust across data sources.

Method: Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS) augments raw player positions/velocities with relational variables (space scoring, pass, score) and uses action masking to give on-ball/off-ball agents distinct decision sets, mapping learned functions to tactical concepts.

Result: EDMS with action masking consistently reduced action-prediction loss and temporal-difference error compared to baselines. Q-value visualizations revealed high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns like fast counterattacks and defensive breakthroughs.

Conclusion: EDMS enables interpretable tactical analysis by mapping learned agent behaviors to human-understandable concepts, supports cross-dataset compatibility, and provides a foundation for reproducible sports analytics research.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that process reward models (PRMs) are superior to outcome reward models (ORMs) for evaluating LLM reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation across 14 domains, the authors find that generative outcome reward models (GenORM) actually outperform other variants, showing that fine-grained stepwise supervision is not always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that process reward models (PRMs) are inherently superior to outcome reward models (ORMs) for evaluating LLM reasoning reliability, especially given that prior evidence mainly comes from narrow math domains.

Method: Conducted a unified evaluation of four reward model variants (discriminative ORM/PRM and generative ORM/PRM) across 14 diverse domains, with theoretical analysis of error compounding in stepwise scoring.

Result: Contrary to conventional wisdom: (i) DisORM performs on par with DisPRM, (ii) GenPRM is not competitive, and (iii) GenORM is the most robust, yielding significant and consistent gains across all tested domains.

Conclusion: Stepwise scoring inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and struggles with long reasoning trajectories, while generative outcome verification proves more robust for multi-domain deployment, challenging the assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

*Wei-Yao Wang,Kazuya Tateishi,Qiyu Wu,Shusuke Takahashi,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIRTUE is a visual-interactive text-image universal embedder that extends segmentation models and vision-language models to representation learning, enabling precise handling of complex scenarios through visual prompts and achieving state-of-the-art performance on universal and visual-interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users, which limits their human-interactive applicability and ability to learn entity-level information within images to complement global representations.

Method: VIRTUE integrates segmentation models and vision-language models, allowing segmentation models to process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within images, enabling more precise handling of complex and ambiguous scenarios.

Result: VIRTUE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB tasks (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%-20.3%), evaluated on a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval benchmark with 1M samples.

Conclusion: VIRTUE successfully extends visual-interactive capabilities to embedding models, unlocking new applications with localized grounding of user intent and enhancing entity-level learning within images while maintaining strong performance on conventional embedding tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: This study develops 15 data quality dimensions for RAG systems through interviews with IT practitioners, revealing the need for new dimensions, front-loaded quality strategies, and dynamic quality management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data quality frameworks are inadequate for RAG systems due to their dynamic, multi-stage nature, creating a gap in addressing quality issues in AI-based systems.

Method: Conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from leading IT service companies and performed qualitative content analysis to inductively derive data quality dimensions.

Result: Identified 15 distinct data quality dimensions across four RAG processing stages: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.

Conclusion: RAG systems require new data quality dimensions concentrated in early stages, front-loaded quality management strategies, and dynamic approaches to handle quality issue transformation and propagation.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

TL;DR: DLMs have vulnerability in iterative denoising that allows jailbreak attacks via affirmative token injection. Proposed safety alignment method trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address safety risks in diffusion language models (DLMs) stemming from their parallel token generation through iterative denoising, which can be exploited by jailbreak attacks.

Method: Proposed a novel safety alignment method that trains DLMs to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states containing affirmative tokens, specifically designed for the iterative denoising process.

Result: The method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance and improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: DLMs have critical vulnerabilities requiring DLM-specific safety research, and the proposed alignment method effectively addresses these security concerns.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of growing context length in LLM agents for long-horizon tasks, which increases costs and reduces efficiency, as existing context compression methods focus mainly on single-step tasks.

Method: Uses compression guideline optimization in natural language space: LLMs analyze failure cases from paired trajectories (full vs compressed context) and update compression guidelines accordingly, then distills optimized compressors into smaller models.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs with up to 46% performance improvement.

Conclusion: ACON provides an effective solution for context compression in agentic tasks, enabling more efficient long-horizon reasoning while maintaining performance, with practical benefits for deploying smaller language models as agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

### [230] [Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis with Energy-Aware Secure Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00976)
*Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFFR framework combines few-shot federated learning, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation to improve rare-disease diagnosis while addressing data scarcity, privacy, and device constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-disease diagnosis faces challenges from extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and limited edge device resources, requiring a unified solution.

Method: Integrates three pillars: few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy.

Result: Achieves up to 10% accuracy improvement over baseline FL, reduces client dropouts by over 50%, and maintains clinically acceptable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: AFFR provides a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

### [231] [HARPA: A Testability-Driven, Literature-Grounded Framework for Research Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00620)
*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an AI system for automated scientific discovery that generates testable, literature-grounded hypotheses by mining research trends, exploring hypothesis spaces, and converging on precise hypotheses. It outperforms baselines in feasibility and groundedness, and learns from experimental outcomes to improve hypothesis generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated scientific discovery where existing tools struggle to generate testable, literature-grounded hypotheses and lack adaptability to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA incorporates human researcher workflow: 1) literature mining to identify emerging trends, 2) exploring hypothesis design spaces, 3) converging on precise hypotheses by identifying research gaps and justifying design choices. It also learns a reward model from experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA-generated proposals perform comparably to baseline AI-researcher on most qualitative dimensions, with significant gains in feasibility (+0.78, p<0.05) and groundedness (+0.85, p<0.01). With CodeScientist agent, achieved more successful executions (20 vs 11/40) and fewer failures (16 vs 21/40). Reward model achieved ~28% absolute gain over untrained baseline.

Conclusion: HARPA represents a step forward in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more feasible and grounded hypotheses that better track with actual execution success, and adaptively learning from experimental outcomes.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [232] [Is Model Editing Built on Sand? Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625)
*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current model editing methods appear reliable but actually exploit shortcuts rather than real semantic understanding, making them fragile under proper evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental flaws in current model editing literature where apparent success is illusory and based on exploiting shortcuts rather than true knowledge integration.

Method: Systematically developed a suite of new evaluation methods with negative examples to test model editing robustness, particularly using negation queries.

Result: State-of-the-art model editing approaches collapse under simple negation queries, revealing they rely on shortcuts rather than full semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Model editing is likely based on shortcuts rather than real semantics, requiring urgent reconsideration of the field's foundations before meaningful progress can be made.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

### [233] [Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627)
*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDDM is a lightweight trajectory prediction method that uses collaborative progressive distillation to compress diffusion models, achieving 161x model compression and 31x speedup while maintaining 96% of original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong trajectory prediction performance but are too large and slow for real-world autonomous vehicle deployment. There's a need for lightweight, real-time prediction models.

Method: Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD) transfers knowledge from teacher to student diffusion model, reducing both sampling steps and model size. Uses dual-signal regularized distillation loss combining teacher guidance and ground-truth data.

Result: Achieves 96.2% ADE and 95.5% FDE performance of baseline on pedestrian trajectories with only 231K parameters and 2-4 sampling steps (161x compression, 31x acceleration, 9ms latency). State-of-the-art on ETH-UCY and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: CDDM successfully bridges high-performance generative models with practical deployment constraints, enabling resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expected Attention is a training-free KV cache compression method that predicts future query attention to KV pairs, enabling efficient pruning without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory consumption of KV cache is a major bottleneck for LLM inference, and existing attention-score-based pruning methods face practical limitations like unavailability of future token attention scores and inaccessibility of past scores in modern implementations.

Method: Uses distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair, enabling principled ranking and pruning while minimizing impact on the residual stream.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prefilling and decoding phases, achieving effective compression without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method provides seamless KV cache compression across all inference phases and the authors release KVPress library with 20+ techniques for researchers to implement and benchmark compression methods.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

### [236] [Relevance-Zone Reduction in Game Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00689)
*Chi-Huang Lin,Ting Han Wei,Chun-Jui Wang,Hung Guei,Chung-Chin Shih,Yun-Jui Tsai,I-Chen Wu,Ti-Rong Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an iterative method to reduce Relevance-Zone (RZ) sizes in game solving, enabling more efficient strategy reuse and pruning through constraint generation and pattern tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game solving faces exponential growth in game trees, making many games unsolvable. While RZ technique reduces search space by focusing on relevant regions, different solutions create varying RZ sizes, with smaller ones being preferable for better reuse and pruning efficiency.

Method: Iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves positions while gradually restricting involved regions, using three constraint generation strategies and integrating an RZ Pattern Table to leverage past solutions.

Result: On 7x7 Killall-Go, the method reduces average RZ size to 85.95% of original size.

Conclusion: Reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable knowledge for future solving tasks, particularly beneficial for larger board sizes or different openings.

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

*Yunhao Wang,Ziting Li,Shuai Chen,Tao Liu,Chao Song,Junjie Jiang,Jian Zhu,Peng Gao,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACPO is a novel reinforcement learning framework that improves VLM alignment through adaptive curriculum learning and dynamic clipping mechanisms, achieving SOTA performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy optimization algorithms like PPO have limitations including static training schedules and rigid clipping mechanisms, which hinder effective alignment of vision-language models for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ACPO uses dual adaptive strategies: 1) Dynamic curriculum that transitions from on-policy exploration to off-policy exploitation by progressively increasing sample reuse; 2) Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) that replaces fixed clipping with dynamic, sample-wise bounds based on normalized advantage.

Result: Extensive experiments on MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro benchmarks show ACPO consistently outperforms DAPO and PAPO baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accelerated convergence and superior training stability.

Conclusion: ACPO effectively addresses limitations of existing policy optimization methods through its adaptive learning framework, demonstrating significant improvements in VLM alignment for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

TL;DR: AttentionDep is a domain-aware attention model that uses social media posts for depression severity detection, incorporating mental health knowledge graphs and providing explainable predictions through attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms offer insights into individuals' mental states, making them valuable for depression detection. The goal is to create trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment.

Method: Hierarchical encoding of posts using unigrams and bigrams with attention mechanisms, incorporation of domain knowledge from mental health knowledge graphs via cross-attention, and ordinal regression framework for severity prediction.

Result: AttentionDep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets while providing interpretable insights.

Conclusion: The work advances the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media data.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvolProver is a 7B-parameter theorem prover trained with novel data augmentation methods (EvolAST, EvolDomain, EvolDifficulty) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple formal math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragility and lack of generalizability in LLMs for formal theorem proving by enhancing model robustness through systematic data augmentation.

Method: Three data augmentation approaches: EvolAST (syntactic symmetry via AST transformations), EvolDomain (semantic symmetry via cross-domain theorem translation), and EvolDifficulty (generating theorems with varying difficulty levels).

Result: EvolProver achieves 53.8% pass@32 on FormalMATH-Lite, 69.8% on MiniF2F-Test, 52.2% on Ineq-Comp-Seed, and 34.0% on Ineq-Comp-Transformed, setting new SOTA records for non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation pipeline significantly enhances theorem proving robustness and performance, with EvolProver outperforming all comparable models including reasoning-based ones.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA), a defensive method that disrupts the DDIM inversion trajectory to prevent malicious editing of real images using diffusion models, outperforming previous defense approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models enable easy editing of real images through DDIM inversion, which has been misused for creating deepfakes and unethical content. Existing defenses like AdvDM and Photoguard are ineffective due to misalignment with the iterative denoising process.

Method: DIA attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path by disrupting the inversion process that malicious users rely on for image editing, making it harder to generate manipulated content.

Result: DIA effectively disrupts the diffusion process and surpasses previous defensive methods across various editing techniques, providing stronger protection against malicious use.

Conclusion: The proposed DIA framework offers practical defense against malicious AI applications and can benefit both industry and research community in combating unethical image manipulation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical

Result: Shows that under certain conditions, weighted knowledge bases and defeasible conditionals can generate the same ordering on interpretations, establishing semantic equivalence up to relative cost.

Conclusion: The equivalence results between cost-based semantics and c-representations can benefit further work on both formalisms by enabling cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques.

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

### [244] [Logical Consistency Between Disagreeing Experts and Its Role in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00821)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes a logic for unsupervised evaluation of classifiers by analyzing agreements and disagreements between experts, using linear programming to find logically consistent evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the asymmetry in utility between agreements and disagreements among experts, and develop a method for unsupervised evaluation without ground truth labels.

Method: Formalizes a logic using linear programming in integer space, with inequalities for logical constraints and axioms as linear equalities applicable to all finite tests.

Result: Developed no-knowledge alarms that can detect when LLMs-as-Judges violate minimum grading thresholds using only logical consistency.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practical utility for unsupervised evaluation by leveraging logical consistency of agreements and disagreements between classifiers.

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative benchmarking study of classical machine learning models for fault classification and localization in power systems using EMT data, achieving high performance with F1 score of 0.992 for FC and R2 of 0.806 for FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional protection schemes with fixed thresholds cannot reliably handle fault classification and localization in modern power grids with increasing distributed energy resources and dynamic conditions, creating a need for machine learning alternatives.

Method: Used classical ML models evaluated on voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows (10-50ms) under realistic real-time constraints, with performance assessed for accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency.

Result: Best-performing fault classification model achieved F1 score of 0.992±0.001, while top fault localization model reached R2 of 0.806±0.008 with mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: Machine learning models provide effective solutions for fault classification and localization in power system protection, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency suitable for real-time applications in complex grid environments.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to learn compact representations of LLM abilities using item response theory and Mixture-of-Experts networks for efficient model routing and performance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in large language models creates challenges in efficiently managing and utilizing these resources, requiring better ways to understand model capabilities and route queries appropriately.

Method: Frames the problem as estimating model correctness probability using item response theory with three factors: model's multi-skill ability vector, query's discrimination vector, and query's difficulty scalar. Uses Mixture-of-Experts network to jointly learn these parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively learns compact representations of LLM abilities that facilitate downstream tasks like model routing and performance prediction, providing interpretable insights into model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: AIDE's MCTS-based framework provides significant extensibility for future integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge, representing a valuable step toward comprehensive automated knowledge discovery solutions.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future

*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter is a novel method for few-shot relationship learning in multimodal knowledge graphs that uses adapter modules and fusion strategies to preserve modality-specific characteristics while improving generalization to novel relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKG methods align modalities into shared spaces but overlook distinct modality contributions, limiting performance in low-resource settings where different modalities provide complementary information.

Method: Proposes FusionAdapter with: (1) adapter modules for efficient modality adaptation to unseen relations, (2) fusion strategy integrating multimodal entity representations while preserving modality-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets show FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FusionAdapter effectively adapts and fuses diverse modality information, improving generalization to novel relations with minimal supervision in multimodal knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Shashank Reddy Chirra,Jayden Teoh,Praveen Paruchuri,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL introduces a meta-learned adversarial imitation learning algorithm that discovers data-driven reward assignment functions through LLM-guided evolution, outperforming human-designed baselines and improving training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIL methods rely on human-designed reward assignment functions derived from divergence minimization, which overlooks the impact of reward assignment on training dynamics and final policy performance.

Method: Leverage LLM-guided evolutionary framework to explore the space of reward assignment functions, discovering data-driven RA functions based directly on imitation policy performance.

Result: DAIL generalizes across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art human-designed baselines and demonstrating more stable training.

Conclusion: The discovered reward assignment functions provide novel insights into AIL stability and show that data-driven approaches can outperform human-designed methods in adversarial imitation learning.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes test-time search with stochasticity to enhance neural separation for CVRP, introducing stochastic edge selection and GraphCHiP algorithm to identify both RCIs and FCIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based separation methods for CVRP produce fewer cuts than expected due to insufficient sensitivity to generate diverse subsets.

Method: 1) Stochastic edge selection in graph coarsening procedure; 2) Graph Coarsening History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm that leverages coarsening history to identify RCIs and FCIs.

Result: Experiments show reduced dual gap compared to existing neural separation method, and successful discovery of effective FCIs on specific instances.

Conclusion: Test-time search with stochasticity effectively enhances trained models' performance for cut generation in CVRP, enabling identification of both RCIs and FCIs.

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

TL;DR: QUASAR is an agentic RL framework that uses tool-augmented LLMs to generate and optimize quantum circuits, addressing challenges in parameter precision and domain knowledge through verification and hierarchical rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum circuit generation faces challenges with precise parameter values and lack of quantum-specific knowledge, leading to low-quality circuits.

Method: Proposes QUASAR framework with quantum circuit verification using external simulators and hierarchical reward mechanism in RL training.

Result: Achieved 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3 and other baselines.

Conclusion: QUASAR effectively improves quantum circuit generation by combining LLMs with quantum-specific verification and RL optimization.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

TL;DR: A unified after-sales demand forecasting system combining statistical, ML, and deep learning models with AI-powered analytics for 90+ countries and 6,000+ parts, featuring COVID-19 regime handling, Pareto segmentation, and role-aware reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of after-sales demand forecasting across multiple countries and parts, providing not just predictions but actionable insights for inventory decisions and business planning.

Method: Uses an ensemble of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models with exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators). Implements Pareto-aware segmentation for high-revenue items, horizon-aware ensembling with business-relevant losses, and includes LLMs for automated reporting and narrative generation.

Result: Produces country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals, performance scorecards with accuracy metrics, bias decomposition, trend analysis, and AI-generated narratives for planners and executives across 90+ countries and 6,000+ parts.

Conclusion: The system successfully closes the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions by providing reproducible workflows, actionable insights, and automated reporting that helps planners move from assessing current accuracy to proactive decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow - request specification,
model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated narratives - so
planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is accuracy heading
and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between forecasting,
monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries and about
6,000 parts.

Conclusion: Findings support a model of entity-based reasoning where LMs encode and transform structured representations, shedding light on the functional role of feature manifolds in language models.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 70+ LLMs on triplet similarity tasks using THINGS database concepts to measure human-model representational alignment. Key findings: instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality improve alignment, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited effect. Existing benchmarks inadequately capture representational alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which computational ingredients (architectures, fine-tuning methods, training datasets) are most crucial for developing human-like representations in LLMs, and address the limitation that current benchmarks don't effectively measure representational alignment between humans and models.

Method: Evaluated over 70 models with varying computational ingredients on triplet similarity tasks using concepts from THINGS database, comparing human and model representations to measure alignment.

Result: Models with instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality showed highest human alignment. Multimodal pretraining and parameter size had limited bearing on alignment. Existing benchmarks (MMLU, MUSR) inadequately capture representational alignment variance.

Conclusion: Instruction-finetuning and attention head dimensionality are key ingredients for advancing LLMs towards human conceptual models. Current benchmarks have significant gaps in measuring human-AI representational alignment, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods.

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Activation-Deactivation (AD), a novel forward-pass paradigm for explaining CNN decisions by deactivating model parts corresponding to occluded features, avoiding out-of-distribution issues of traditional occlusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional black-box explainability methods rely on occluding input parts, creating out-of-distribution images and requiring domain knowledge for occlusion value selection, which raises doubts about explanation quality.

Method: Introduces ConvAD, a drop-in mechanism implementing AD paradigm that switches off model parts corresponding to occluded features, removing their effects from decision-making without changing the network's decision process.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows AD explanations achieve up to 62.5% improvement in robustness compared to occlusion-based explanations, with consistent improvements across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: ConvAD provides more robust explanations without requiring additional training or domain knowledge, addressing key limitations of traditional occlusion-based explainability methods.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes using Curry-Howard correspondence to verify Chain-of-Thought reasoning faithfulness by mapping natural language steps to formal proof structures as verifiable certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the faithfulness problem in CoT reasoning for model interpretability, moving beyond heuristic approaches to formal verification.

Method: Extract and map informal CoT steps into formal typed proof structures using Curry-Howard correspondence paradigm, treating reasoning traces as well-typed programs.

Result: Successfully converting CoT traces into well-typed proofs serves as verifiable certificates of computational faithfulness.

Conclusion: Framework transforms narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering path to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

*Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Haibo Tong,Jindong Li,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIRL uses LLMs' internal safety instincts as reward signals for reinforcement learning, achieving high defense success rates against jailbreak attacks without external validators or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety approaches lack universal standards and reliable content validators, making it hard to obtain effective training signals for alignment.

Method: Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL) transforms models' internal confidence in refusing harmful requests into self-generated reward signals, teaching models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors.

Result: SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates against 20+ jailbreak methods using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, surpassing resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective alignment can emerge from within models, enabling more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-layer human-centric production planning framework combining CP for order-line allocation and MDP for worker-line allocation, validated in automotive industry with improved efficiency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in industrial manufacturing by integrating human factors into production planning.

Method: Two-layer framework: first layer uses Constraint Programming for Order-Line allocation respecting machine constraints; second layer uses Markov Decision Process for Worker-Line allocation considering worker preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints. Three solution strategies (greedy, MCTS, RL) compared.

Result: CP-based scheduling produces compact, feasible production plans with low tardiness; MDP-based worker allocation significantly improves fairness and preference alignment. Validated through 16 test sessions with automotive industry experts.

Conclusion: Combining CP with learning-based decision-making provides robust approach for human-centric production planning, enabling simultaneous optimization of throughput and workforce well-being.

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult extends PRISM into a routed expert architecture where a lightweight router dispatches clinical episodes to domain specialists, achieving efficient computation while maintaining safety and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, safe, and efficient clinical consultation system that can handle diverse medical domains while maintaining parameter efficiency and auditability for real-world emergency department deployment.

Method: Uses a panel-of-experts architecture with structured clinical event tokenization. A router reads initial tokens and dispatches to domain specialists (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, etc.), each inheriting PRISM's small transformer backbone for parameter efficiency.

Result: Specialists show smooth convergence with low perplexities across domains. The router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all approach under safety-first policy. Per-domain results avoid dominance by common events.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical path to safe, auditable, low-latency clinical consultation at scale, with validation steps outlined for prospective clinical deployment standards.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

*Evan Heus,Rick Bookstaber,Dhruv Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis that treats supply chains as knowledge graphs, uses network centrality for retrieval, and employs context shells to make quantitative data understandable to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-modal financial risk data, standard RAG oversimplifies relationships, and specialist models are costly and static.

Method: Treat supply chain as knowledge graph, use graph traverser guided by network centrality for retrieval, orchestrate with numerical factor tables and news streams using context shells to embed quantitative data in natural language.

Result: Enables generation of concise, explainable, context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or dedicated graph database.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and complex financial risk analysis through network-KG duality and context shells.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker is a 15B parameter multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier performance through progressive three-stage training design rather than scale, matching larger models while being deployable on single GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that frontier-level multimodal reasoning can be achieved through thoughtful training design rather than massive scale, making advanced AI accessible to organizations with limited computational resources.

Method: Three-stage progressive methodology: (1) depth upscaling from Pixtral-12B, (2) staged continual pre-training with synthetic data for visual reasoning, and (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning with explicit reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves score of 52 on Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (matching DeepSeek-R1-0528), and within 5 points of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7 across ten image benchmarks, while being deployable on single GPU.

Conclusion: Thoughtful mid-training design can close substantial capability gaps without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to organizations with limited infrastructure.

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridge enables parallel LLM inference by generating interdependent responses through holistic tensor processing of batched hidden states, improving response quality and consistency with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel LLM inference generates responses independently, wasting potential information sharing between parallel generations and inefficiently partitioning compute resources.

Method: Bridge treats batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices, allowing interdependent response generation with only 2.8%-5.1% new parameters.

Result: Bridge improves relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50% and boosts consistency of correct responses, scaling to any generation width with better performance than independent generations.

Conclusion: Bridge unlocks a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel hardware Trojan attack that covertly leaks AI model weights from wireless devices through hidden communication channels, enabling adversaries to incrementally reconstruct complete weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models are valuable intellectual property with high development costs and competitive advantages, making model stealing attacks a serious concern for AI model providers.

Method: Two-phase attack: 1) Compromise device with hardware Trojan to leak model weights covertly 2) Use nearby wireless device to intercept transmissions and incrementally reconstruct weight matrices. The attack is agnostic to AI model architecture and hardware accelerator.

Result: Validated through hardware demonstration with four diverse AI models. Demonstrated effective weight extraction with error mitigation techniques. Evaluated based on reconstruction accuracy and extraction time.

Conclusion: The attack successfully demonstrates vulnerability of AI hardware accelerators to covert weight extraction. Proposed defense mechanisms to counter such hardware-based model stealing attacks.

Abstract: AI models are often regarded as valuable intellectual property due to the
high cost of their development, the competitive advantage they provide, and the
proprietary techniques involved in their creation. As a result, AI model
stealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,
we present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware
accelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the
victim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly
leak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim
realizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device
to intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and
incrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is
agnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.
We validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four
diverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT
and the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature. Additionally, we
analyze the impact of bit error rates on the reception and propose an error
mitigation technique. The effectiveness of the attack is evaluated based on the
accuracy of the reconstructed models with stolen weights and the time required
to extract them. Finally, we explore potential defense mechanisms.

*Dominik Apel,Zeta Avarikioti,Matteo Maffei,Yuheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Calyx is the first privacy-preserving multi-token optimistic rollup protocol that ensures full payment privacy for L2 transactions while maintaining data availability through efficient fraud proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rollup protocols require publishing plaintext transaction data on-chain for data availability, which inherently compromises user privacy by revealing sender, recipient, amount, and token type information.

Method: Calyx uses a privacy-preserving optimistic rollup approach with one-step fraud-proof mechanism, supporting atomic execution of multiple multi-token transactions and implementing a transaction fee scheme for sustainable operation.

Result: The protocol achieves full payment privacy with approximately $0.06 per transaction cost (0.00002 ETH) and only constant-size on-chain cost in asymptotic terms.

Conclusion: Calyx successfully addresses the privacy limitations of existing rollup protocols while maintaining scalability and security through efficient fraud proofs and privacy-preserving transaction execution.

Abstract: Rollup protocols have recently received significant attention as a promising
class of Layer 2 (L2) scalability solutions. By utilizing the Layer 1 (L1)
blockchain solely as a bulletin board for a summary of the executed
transactions and state changes, rollups enable secure off-chain execution while
avoiding the complexity of other L2 mechanisms. However, to ensure data
availability, current rollup protocols require the plaintext of executed
transactions to be published on-chain, resulting in inherent privacy
limitations.
  In this paper, we address this problem by introducing Calyx, the first
privacy-preserving multi-token optimistic-Rollup protocol. Calyx guarantees
full payment privacy for all L2 transactions, revealing no information about
the sender, recipient, transferred amount, or token type. The protocol further
supports atomic execution of multiple multi-token transactions and introduces a
transaction fee scheme to enable broader application scenarios while ensuring
the sustainable operation of the protocol. To enforce correctness, Calyx adopts
an efficient one-step fraud-proof mechanism. We analyze the security and
privacy guarantees of the protocol and provide an implementation and
evaluation. Our results show that executing a single transaction costs
approximately $0.06 (0.00002 ETH) and incurs only constant-size on-chain cost
in asymptotic terms.

TL;DR: CHAI is a new prompt-based attack that exploits multimodal language interpretation in Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) by embedding deceptive natural language instructions in visual inputs to hijack embodied AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks in embodied AI systems where common-sense reasoning capabilities create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited through multimodal attacks.

Method: CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions in visual input, systematically searches token space, builds prompt dictionaries, and uses attacker models to generate Visual Attack Prompts targeting LVLM agents.

Result: CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across four LVLM agents in drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and real robotic vehicle scenarios.

Conclusion: CHAI demonstrates that exploiting semantic and multimodal reasoning in next-generation embodied AI systems requires defenses beyond traditional adversarial robustness, highlighting urgent security needs.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in
robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning
grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions
and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also
create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking
against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the
multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models
(LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as
misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space,
builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual
Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing,
autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle.
Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of
next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for
defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: SecureBERT 2.0 provides an effective encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications, demonstrating superior performance in critical cybersecurity tasks through domain-specific adaptation and enhanced architectural features.

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands
language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document
structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code.
Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust
representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical

*Youpeng Li,Kartik Joshi,Xinda Wang,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MAVUL is a multi-agent vulnerability detection system that uses contextual reasoning and iterative interactions between specialized agents to improve vulnerability detection performance and evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vulnerability detection methods suffer from inadequate contextual understanding, single-round interactions, and coarse-grained evaluations, leading to poor performance and biased results.

Method: Proposes MAVUL with multiple specialized agents: vulnerability analyst agent for cross-procedural code understanding and pattern mining, security architect agent for iterative feedback, and evaluation agent for multi-dimensional assessment. Uses iterative cross-role interactions for refined decision-making.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing multi-agent systems (62% higher pairwise accuracy) and single-agent systems (600% higher average performance). Performance improves with more communication rounds between agents.

Conclusion: Multi-agent collaboration with contextual reasoning and iterative feedback is crucial for effective vulnerability detection. The integrated evaluation agent prevents misleading binary comparisons and ensures reliable real-world applicability assessment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of open-source software (OSS) necessitates the
mitigation of vulnerability risks. Most vulnerability detection (VD) methods
are limited by inadequate contextual understanding, restrictive single-round
interactions, and coarse-grained evaluations, resulting in undesired model
performance and biased evaluation results. To address these challenges, we
propose MAVUL, a novel multi-agent VD system that integrates contextual
reasoning and interactive refinement. Specifically, a vulnerability analyst
agent is designed to flexibly leverage tool-using capabilities and contextual
reasoning to achieve cross-procedural code understanding and effectively mine
vulnerability patterns. Through iterative feedback and refined decision-making
within cross-role agent interactions, the system achieves reliable reasoning
and vulnerability prediction. Furthermore, MAVUL introduces multi-dimensional
ground truth information for fine-grained evaluation, thereby enhancing
evaluation accuracy and reliability.
  Extensive experiments conducted on a pairwise vulnerability dataset
demonstrate MAVUL's superior performance. Our findings indicate that MAVUL
significantly outperforms existing multi-agent systems with over 62% higher
pairwise accuracy and single-agent systems with over 600% higher average
performance. The system's effectiveness is markedly improved with increased
communication rounds between the vulnerability analyst agent and the security
architect agent, underscoring the importance of contextual reasoning in tracing
vulnerability flows and the crucial feedback role. Additionally, the integrated
evaluation agent serves as a critical, unbiased judge, ensuring a more accurate
and reliable estimation of the system's real-world applicability by preventing
misleading binary comparisons.

*Günter F. Steinke,Thomas Steinke*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a differentially private scheme for black-box functions that balances statistical efficiency and oracle efficiency, addressing limitations of existing methods that require sensitivity bounds or exponential evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard differential privacy techniques require sensitivity bounds, which are often unavailable or too large. Existing black-box methods are either statistically inefficient or require exponentially many function evaluations.

Method: The authors propose a scheme that trades off between statistical efficiency (data requirements) and oracle efficiency (number of function evaluations), providing a practical alternative to existing approaches.

Result: The paper presents both the proposed scheme and lower bounds demonstrating its near-optimality in balancing the trade-off between statistical and oracle efficiency.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient differentially private method for black-box functions that overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, with theoretical guarantees showing its near-optimal performance.

Abstract: Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or
Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the
estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply
unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to
arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are
either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on
exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off
between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle
efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds
showing the near-optimality of our scheme.

### [271] [Security and Privacy Analysis of Tile's Location Tracking Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00350)
*Akshaya Kumar,Anna Raymaker,Michael Specter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Security analysis of Tile location-tracking service reveals multiple vulnerabilities: servers can track all users, Bluetooth tracking is possible, anti-theft mode is subvertible, and accountability mechanism is flawed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tile is the second most popular crowd-sourced location-tracking service with millions of users, but lacks formal protocol description and threat model, while intentionally weakening anti-stalking features for anti-theft purposes.

Method: Comprehensive security analysis identifying exploitable vulnerabilities and design flaws in Tile's system, examining their accountability mechanism and protocol weaknesses.

Result: Found that Tile's servers can persistently learn all user locations, unprivileged adversaries can track users via Bluetooth, anti-theft mode is easily subverted, and accountability mechanism introduces new vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Tile's security and privacy guarantees are disproven, their accountability mechanism is subvertible, and there is a need for new formal definitions of accountability in crowd-sourced location tracking systems.

Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive security analysis of Tile, the second most
popular crowd-sourced location-tracking service behind Apple's AirTags. We
identify several exploitable vulnerabilities and design flaws, disproving many
of the platform's claimed security and privacy guarantees: Tile's servers can
persistently learn the location of all users and tags, unprivileged adversaries
can track users through Bluetooth advertisements emitted by Tile's devices, and
Tile's anti-theft mode is easily subverted.
  Despite its wide deployment -- millions of users, devices, and purpose-built
hardware tags -- Tile provides no formal description of its protocol or threat
model. Worse, Tile intentionally weakens its antistalking features to support
an antitheft use-case and relies on a novel "accountability" mechanism to
punish those abusing the system to stalk victims.
  We examine Tile's accountability mechanism, a unique feature of independent
interest; no other provider attempts to guarantee accountability. While an
ideal accountability mechanism may disincentivize abuse in crowd-sourced
location tracking protocols, we show that Tile's implementation is subvertible
and introduces new exploitable vulnerabilities. We conclude with a discussion
on the need for new, formal definitions of accountability in this setting.

Conclusion: PromptShield provides robust security solution for generative AI applications, laying groundwork for AI safety standards and demonstrating critical role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in safe LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread prominence, yet their
vulnerability to prompt injection and other adversarial attacks remains a
critical concern. This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that
proactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To
achieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that
ensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user
inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating
adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance
capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze
cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events
related to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection
attacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results
demonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance,
achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%. Notably, the
ontology-based framework not only mitigates adversarial threats but also
enhances the overall performance and reliability of the system. Furthermore,
PromptShield's modular and adaptable design ensures its applicability beyond
cloud security, making it a robust solution for safeguarding generative AI
applications across various domains. By laying the groundwork for AI safety
standards and informing future policy development, this work stimulates a
crucial dialogue on the pivotal role of deterministic prompt engineering and
ontology-based validation in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: CIAF provides a robust solution for diverse cyberattacks, laying foundation for standardized forensic methodologies and paving way for efficient, automated forensic workflows in cloud security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including
cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on
manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic
human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To
address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF),
an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic
logs while improving efficiency and accuracy. CIAF standardizes user inputs
through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistency in
log interpretation. This not only enhances data quality but also provides
investigators with reliable, standardized information for decision-making. To
evaluate security and performance, we analyzed Microsoft Azure logs containing
ransomware-related events. By simulating attacks and assessing CIAF's impact,
results showed significant improvement in ransomware detection, achieving
precision, recall, and F1 scores of 93 percent. CIAF's modular, adaptable
design extends beyond ransomware, making it a robust solution for diverse
cyberattacks. By laying the foundation for standardized forensic methodologies
and informing future AI-driven automation, this work underscores the role of
deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in enhancing
cloud forensic investigations. These advancements improve cloud security while
paving the way for efficient, automated forensic workflows.

### [274] [Has the Two-Decade-Old Prophecy Come True? Artificial Bad Intelligence Triggered by Merely a Single-Bit Flip in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00490)
*Yu Yan,Siqi Lu,Yang Gao,Zhaoxuan Li,Ziming Zhao,Qingjun Yuan,Yongjuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper discovers single-bit vulnerabilities in LLM weight files (.gguf formats) where flipping just one bit can cause semantic failures like factual errors, reasoning degradation, or harmful content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs being deployed in single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces are exposed to hardware attacks like Bit-Flip Attack (BFA), creating an unprecedented attack surface that needs systematic investigation.

Method: Built an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and probabilistic heuristic scanning framework (BitSifter) to efficiently locate critical vulnerable bits in large parameter models.

Result: Found vulnerabilities concentrated in tensor data regions, especially attention mechanisms and output layers. Smaller models are more vulnerable. Achieved 100% success flipping single bits in 31.7 seconds at 464.3 attacks/second, dropping LLM accuracy from 73.5% to 0%.

Conclusion: LLMs in .gguf formats are highly vulnerable to single-bit flip attacks that can cause semantic-level failures, with smaller models being more susceptible, demonstrating a serious security threat requiring attention.

Abstract: Recently, Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) has garnered widespread attention for its
ability to compromise software system integrity remotely through hardware fault
injection. With the widespread distillation and deployment of large language
models (LLMs) into single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces have become
exposed to an unprecedented hardware attack surface. This paper is the first to
systematically discover and validate the existence of single-bit
vulnerabilities in LLM weight files: in mainstream open-source models (e.g.,
DeepSeek and QWEN) using .gguf quantized formats, flipping just single bit can
induce three types of targeted semantic level failures Artificial Flawed
Intelligence (outputting factual errors), Artificial Weak Intelligence
(degradation of logical reasoning capability), and Artificial Bad Intelligence
(generating harmful content).
  By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a
probabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved
efficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly
concen- trated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the
attention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive. A negative
correlation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models
being more susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was
designed, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an
attack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with
100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds. This causes the accuracy of LLM to
plummet from 73.5% to 0%, without requiring high-cost equipment or complex
prompt engineering.

### [276] [Sentry: Authenticating Machine Learning Artifacts on the Fly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00554)
*Andrew Gan,Zahra Ghodsi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sentry is a GPU-based framework that provides cryptographic authentication for machine learning artifacts to prevent supply chain attacks, achieving significant speedup over CPU-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems are vulnerable to supply chain attacks due to reliance on external datasets and models without authenticity verification, and existing cryptographic solutions have high overhead and GPU incompatibility.

Method: Developed Sentry framework that implements GPU-accelerated cryptographic signing/verification, uses developer identity binding, performs on-the-fly authentication during GPU memory loading, and optimizes memory/resources for high throughput.

Result: Sentry achieves orders of magnitude speedup over CPU-based baseline while providing practical authenticity verification for ML systems.

Conclusion: Sentry provides an efficient GPU-based solution to mitigate ML supply chain attacks through cryptographic authentication, overcoming the limitations of existing CPU-based approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly rely on open-source artifacts such as
datasets and models that are created or hosted by other parties. The reliance
on external datasets and pre-trained models exposes the system to supply chain
attacks where an artifact can be poisoned before it is delivered to the
end-user. Such attacks are possible due to the lack of any authenticity
verification in existing machine learning systems. Incorporating cryptographic
solutions such as hashing and signing can mitigate the risk of supply chain
attacks. However, existing frameworks for integrity verification based on
cryptographic techniques can incur significant overhead when applied to
state-of-the-art machine learning artifacts due to their scale, and are not
compatible with GPU platforms. In this paper, we develop Sentry, a novel
GPU-based framework that verifies the authenticity of machine learning
artifacts by implementing cryptographic signing and verification for datasets
and models. Sentry ties developer identities to signatures and performs
authentication on the fly as artifacts are loaded on GPU memory, making it
compatible with GPU data movement solutions such as NVIDIA GPUDirect that
bypass the CPU. Sentry incorporates GPU acceleration of cryptographic hash
constructions such as Merkle tree and lattice hashing, implementing memory
optimizations and resource partitioning schemes for a high throughput
performance. Our evaluations show that Sentry is a practical solution to bring
authenticity to machine learning systems, achieving orders of magnitude speedup
over a CPU-based baseline.

### [278] [A Monoid Ring Approach to Color Visual Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00763)
*Maximilian Reif,Jens Zumbrägel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a new visual cryptography scheme for color images using a generalized color monoid model that allows arbitrary color stacking, achieving better pixel expansion and contrast than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient visual cryptography schemes for color images that don't require cryptographic knowledge and can be applied to practical applications like QR codes and medical images.

Method: The authors revisit the polynomial framework of Koga and Ishihara and apply monoid ring theory to construct new visual cryptography schemes for color images using a generalized color model that permits arbitrary color stacking.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves shorter pixel expansion and higher contrast compared to comparable existing schemes in color visual cryptography.

Conclusion: The monoid ring approach provides an effective framework for constructing improved visual cryptography schemes for color images with better performance characteristics.

Abstract: A visual cryptography scheme is a secret sharing scheme in which the secret
information is an image and the shares are printed on transparencies, so that
the secret image can be recovered by simply stacking the shares on top of each
other. Such schemes do therefore not require any knowledge of cryptography
tools to recover the secret, and they have widespread applications, for
example, when sharing QR codes or medical images. In this work we deal with
visual cryptography threshold schemes for color images. Our color model differs
from most previous work by allowing arbitrary colors to be stacked, resulting
in a possibly different color. This more general color monoid model enables us
to achieve shorter pixel expansion and higher contrast than comparable schemes.
We revisit the polynomial framework of Koga and Ishihara for constructing
visual cryptography schemes and apply the monoid ring to obtain new schemes for
color visual cryptography.

*Gautier Evennou,Vivien Chappelier,Ewa Kijak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LatentSeal reframes watermarking as semantic communication, using a text autoencoder to embed full-sentence messages as compact latent vectors, breaking the 256-bit payload ceiling while maintaining robustness and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image watermarking treats payload as meaningless bits, imposing capacity limits and preventing watermarks from carrying useful semantic information.

Method: A lightweight text autoencoder maps full-sentence messages into 256D unit-norm latent vectors, embedded by finetuned watermark model with secret invertible rotation for security.

Result: Surpasses prior SOTA in BLEU-4 and Exact Match, achieves ROC AUC 0.97-0.99, survives valuemetric/geometric attacks, and enables real-time decoding.

Conclusion: Shifting from bit payloads to semantic latent vectors enables robust, high-capacity, secure, and interpretable watermarking for provenance and trustworthy AI governance.

Abstract: Most image watermarking systems focus on robustness, capacity, and
imperceptibility while treating the embedded payload as meaningless bits. This
bit-centric view imposes a hard ceiling on capacity and prevents watermarks
from carrying useful information. We propose LatentSeal, which reframes
watermarking as semantic communication: a lightweight text autoencoder maps
full-sentence messages into a compact 256-dimensional unit-norm latent vector,
which is robustly embedded by a finetuned watermark model and secured through a
secret, invertible rotation. The resulting system hides full-sentence messages,
decodes in real time, and survives valuemetric and geometric attacks. It
surpasses prior state of the art in BLEU-4 and Exact Match on several
benchmarks, while breaking through the long-standing 256-bit payload ceiling.
It also introduces a statistically calibrated score that yields a ROC AUC score
of 0.97-0.99, and practical operating points for deployment. By shifting from
bit payloads to semantic latent vectors, LatentSeal enables watermarking that
is not only robust and high-capacity, but also secure and interpretable,
providing a concrete path toward provenance, tamper explanation, and
trustworthy AI governance. Models, training and inference code, and data splits
will be available upon publication.

### [280] [Universally Composable Termination Analysis of Tendermint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01097)
*Zhixin Dong,Xian Xu,Yuhang Zeng,Mingchao Wan,Chunmiao Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents the first universally composable (UC) security analysis of Tendermint, proving its safety and termination properties under strategic message-delay attacks by Byzantine adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous analysis of Tendermint's safety and termination was done in isolation without considering protocol composition, and termination properties under adaptive network delays caused by Byzantine adversaries were not formally analyzed.

Method: The authors construct a UC ideal model of Tendermint, formalizing its core mechanisms (phase-based consensus, dynamic timeouts, proposal locking, leader rotation) under a network adversary that selectively delays protocol messages.

Result: The main result proves that Tendermint protocol UC-realizes the ideal Tendermint model, ensuring bounded termination latency with up to f<n/3 Byzantine nodes when network delays remain within protocol-defined thresholds under partial synchrony.

Conclusion: Through formal UC framework proofs, Tendermint maintains safety and termination, and by UC composition theorem, these properties are preserved when Tendermint is composed with other blockchain components.

Abstract: Modern blockchain systems operating in adversarial environments require
robust consensus protocols that guarantee both safety and termination under
network delay attacks. Tendermint, a widely adopted consensus protocol in
consortium blockchains, achieves high throughput and finality. However,
previous analysis of the safety and termination has been done in a standalone
fashion, with no consideration of the composition with other protocols
interacting with it in a concurrent manner. Moreover, the termination
properties under adaptive network delays caused by Byzantine adversaries have
not been formally analyzed. This paper presents the first universally
composable (UC) security analysis of Tendermint, demonstrating its resilience
against strategic message-delay attacks. By constructing a UC ideal model of
Tendermint, we formalize its core mechanisms: phase-base consensus procedure,
dynamic timeouts, proposal locking, leader rotation, and others, under a
network adversary that selectively delays protocol messages. Our main result
proves that the Tendermint protocol UC-realizes the ideal Tendermint model,
which ensures bounded termination latency, i.e., guaranteed termination, even
when up to $f<n/3$ nodes are Byzantine (where $n$ is the number of nodes
participating in the consensus), provided that network delays remain within a
protocol-defined threshold under the partially synchronous net assumption.
Specifically, through formal proofs within the UC framework, we show that
Tendermint maintains safety and termination. By the composition theorem of UC,
this guarantees that these properties are maintained when Tendermint is
composed with various blockchain components.

### [281] [EditTrack: Detecting and Attributing AI-assisted Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01173)
*Zhengyuan Jiang,Yuyang Zhang,Moyang Guo,Neil Zhenqiang Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EditTrack is a framework for detecting if a suspicious image was edited from a specific base image using AI models, and identifying which editing model was used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only detect if an image is AI-generated/edited, but don't determine if it was derived from a particular base image, creating a gap in image forensics.

Method: Uses a re-editing strategy and carefully designed similarity metrics based on four key observations about the editing process to detect derivation from base images and attribute to specific models.

Result: Evaluated on 5 editing models across 6 datasets, consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming 5 baselines.

Conclusion: EditTrack effectively bridges the gap in image-editing detection and attribution, providing a robust solution for determining image derivation relationships and model identification.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection
and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to
determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an
AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing
model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated
images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether
an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a
particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first
framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on
four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel
re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to
determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,
by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models
across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate
detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.
